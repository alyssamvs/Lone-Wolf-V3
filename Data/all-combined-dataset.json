According to the indictment, Hutaree members view local, state, and federal law enforcement as the “brotherhood”, their enemy, and have been preparing to engage them in armed conflict. The indictment also alleges that the Hutaree planned to kill an unidentified member of local law enforcement and then attack the law enforcement officers who would gather in Michigan for the funeral. According to the plan, the Hutaree would attack law enforcement vehicles during the funeral procession with improvised explosive devices with explosively formed projectiles, which, according to the indictment, constitute weapons of mass destruction. Subsequently, and in furtherance of this plan, David Brian Stone, the Hutaree’s leader, obtained information about such devices over the Internet and e-mailed diagrams of such devices to a person he believed capable of manufacturing the devices. Additionally all nine defndants were charged with carrying or possessing a firearm during a crime of violence on at least one occasion. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty and were aquitted with the exception of David Brian Stone Sr., Joshua John Clough, and Joshua Matthew Stone who pleaded not guilty and were found guilty on some charges and sentenced to time served of 28 months.",

As @doctorpepper35, Giampa tweeted about his hatred of transgender people and his admiration for Adolf Hitler. He tweeted about using Jews as target practice. Online, Giampa had repeatedly interacted with white supremacist groups, in particular the Atomwaffen Division. The Frickers had staged an intervention for their daughter to keep her from dating an \"outspoken neo-Nazi\" and had even reported Giampa's hate speech to the special education high school the two attended. Initially, Giampa was ruled incompetent to stand trial due to brain damage from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. After spending months in a mental hospital, Giampa was deemed competent to stand trial. Giampa's sentencing is coded as data not available because his records are not available through Fairfax County Circuit Court, and his name has not appeared in the news since 2019.",

On the same day of the attack, Edward Clark took his own life, resulting in an escalation of Jeffrey's radicalized views. Two witnesses reported Jeffrey to the FBI due to his extreme agitation, worried he was a threat to himself and others. The witnesses assisted agents in recovering firearms and AR-15-modifying parts and conversion kits, and informed them of Jeffrey's drug use. In court, Jeffrey plead guilty to the drug charge but not the weapon charge, and was sentenced to time served (10 months) and 36 months of supervised release.",

The 150 or so protesters were in the Old Town section of Pasadena on the afternoon of May 31. The agent says the protesters, who were chanting \"Black lives matter here,\" ran out of the way to avoid being hit. After being detained by local police, Hung told authorities that he felt threatened after protesters threw things at his truck, according to the complaint...No evidence corroborated Hung's account, the agent says, and officers who searched his truck found a loaded Glock handgun, a 15-round magazine, a machete, an 18-inch metal pipe, a megaphone and $3,200 in cash...Hung was charged with attempted assault with a deadly weapon in state Superior Court. Court records show that he posted $30,000 bond June 12. An arraignment and plea are scheduled for Tuesday...The complaint alleges that Hung was stockpiling weapons. A photo that authorities said they obtained from his iCloud account that was included in the documents shows assault rifles, semi-automatic pistols, magazines, ammunition, a tactical vest, binoculars, a rifle scope and other equipment. The agents say the guns were likely purchased out of state and kept at the home in San Marino...Hung was charged with illegally acquiring the Glock found in his truck and buying three out-of-state guns that he brought to California.

After being warned by agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that he was a prohibited person, Rankin posted pictures of himself with a firearm on social media. On May 30, 2020, Rankin and others, carrying long guns and pistols, appeared at the Alamo in downtown San Antonio to attend a protest in reaction to the death of George Floyd. The next day, Rankin posted on his Facebook account photos of himself and others carrying a firearm at the protest as well as comments about his disdain for police including, “…hope they burn the precinct down” and “I’m BOOGALOO we hate police.”...on August 4, 2020, Rankin posted a “selfie” photo on his Facebook timeline showing him holding a black, semi-automatic rifle in a vertical position against his shoulder with his finger on the trigger. Rankin posted other photos which included a quote, stating, “Diligently Plotting to Take Over the World in order to Leave You Alone”. On August 11, 2020, Rankin arrived at the airport in Manchester, New Hampshire. He flew out of San Antonio International Airport the previous day. Rankin checked a semiautomatic handgun in his luggage while at the ticket counter, but missed a connecting flight in Philadelphia, PA. Upon his arrival in Manchester, Rankin was met inside the terminal by ATF agents who served Rankin written notice that he is prohibited from possessing firearms. The agents also provided him with copies of his mental health records. Agents seized the handgun and ammunition from inside Rankin’s luggage. Rankin threw the notice letter and mental health records in the trash receptacle before leaving the airport terminal. (DOJ press release)\"",

Rush immediately instructed the Grizzly Scout member on the WhatsApp group to delete evidence on his phone. Rush, Blancas, Ybarra and Miksch then deleted records of their Whatsapp group, including the prior discussions regarding violence against law enforcement and Carrillo’s message to the group—“Dudes i offed a fed” indicating that he had killed a federal law enforcement officer. The indictment also alleges that less than an hour after the shooting in Ben Lomond, Blancas deleted files related to the Grizzly Scouts from a Dropbox account. Further, within hours of the shooting, members of the Grizzly Scouts, including Rush, Blancas, Ybarra, and Miksch allegedly began to reconnect on an alternative communications application. Moreover, the indictment alleges that the four defendants each deleted records of the WhatsApp group communications from their phones, including the prior discussions regarding violence against law enforcement.

While the Capitol riot was ongoing, Grods allegedly rode in a golf cart with others members of the Oath Keepers to the Capitol, then breached the building while carrying what prosecutors describe as a \"large stick.\" Soon after, Grods exited the building as law enforcement used pepper balls to try to force people out of the Capitol, the court documents state. Later, he allegedly met with other members of the Oath Keepers outside the Capitol building, and, in the days after the riot, said he had deleted his messages on Signal. As part of a plea agreement, Grods has agreed to testify in court and sit for interviews with investigators.\" (NPR)",

He said they gave him the orange band and he stayed with them for protection because he had traveled to Washington, D.C. alone. However, the FBI noted that in December, one of his social media connections tagged him in a post about a group of Proud Boys being in New York City. In a social media post included in the court records, Jackson said he didn't agree with the \"MAGA tribalism,\" and didn't commit any violence. Jackson stated in the post that he had evidence of BLM, Antifa, police officers and \"Non Trump\" extremists \"causing the mayhem.\" Jackson also stated that he's a college student studying to be a political science professor. \"My only love is the United States of America,\" he wrote. At the Capitol, records show he carried a U.S. flag and was with a crowd singing The Star-Spangled Banner after the detonation of an explosive device in the crowd.

Bergstrom’s initial arrest was based on probable cause that he committed felony misconduct involving weapons, in violation of Arizona criminal code. After being released, Bergstrom failed to appear for his preliminary hearing, and a bench warrant was subsequently issued for his arrest. On March 13, 2021, Bergstrom was identified by the FBI as a participant in an event in Louisville, Kentucky, which was attended by multiple adherents of the Boogaloo movement. During the event, Bergstrom was arrested by law enforcement, who discovered a handgun on his person. A search warrant for Bergstrom’s cell phone also revealed screen shots of a pair of Greyhound bus tickets from New Mexico to Ohio, purchased under aliases, in an attempt to conceal Bergstrom’s identity and flee Arizona to avoid prosecution.\"",

On the day of the Capitol riot, federal prosecutors allege, Dempsey wore an American flag-themed neck gaiter as well as a combat-style helmet, camouflage pants and a tactical vest. In one video described in court documents, Dempsey stood in front of a gallows erected outside the Capitol and said that Democrats in Congress \"need to hang from these motherf****** [pointing to gallows],\" and that \"Hopefully one day soon we really have someone hanging from one of these motherf******.\" During the riot, Dempsey allegedly used a lacrimal agent -- such as pepper spray -- as well as a crutch and a metal pole to attack police officers guarding the Capitol building. Dempsey was arrested in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2019 over allegedly using bear spray to attack anti-Trump protesters there. Dempsey pleaded no contest to a charge stemming from that incident. The Justice Department notes in its court filings that Dempsey can be seen in multiple photos from Jan. 6 wearing a black- and yellow-colored bracelet. Black and yellow are the colors associated with the far-right extremist group known as the Proud Boys. In one photo described in court documents, Dempsey made the OK sign while standing next to people wearing Proud Boys attire. The \"OK\" sign, which the Proud Boys frequently use, is often associated with supporters of white supremacy, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Dempsey was arrested on Aug. 26.\" (NPR)",

According to local news reporting, Haynes was angry specifically at CNN. \"Court documents also show images taken from another video that allegedly show Haynes, along with two others, attempting to pull an air conditioning unit from outside the Capitol building. Haynes was identified by a tipster who used publicly available facial recognition software to match images from photos with a post from a Parler profile, and agents subsequently pulled the subscriber records to find a phone number and email address. Search warrant records for the phone reportedly show that Haynes used it the day of the riot to take pictures inside the Capitol and at the media staging area, and to text with friends. One selfie depicted Haynes inside the office of a U.S. senator, court documents indicate. Later, texts were allegedly exchanged between Haynes and other individuals that indicated he had broken windows and crawled into the Capitol. Prosecutors say one friend texted Haynes the message “dont [sic] be like antifa tearing stuff up.” Haynes replied, “ahhhh tooooo late,” “broke lotsa stuff,” and then “lol.” Haynes reportedly indicated he was seen destroying media equipment, saying \"i Kicked the fake news a**\" and \"I am in the video destroying stuff but I'm wearing a mask.\" FBI agents went to Haynes' house and interviewed him at length. Haynes allegedly said he believed riot suspects were being treated badly in contrast to people who had participated in Black Lives Matter protests and that he respected those who used force against law enforcement to \"stop the election from being stolen.\" Haynes attended a Proud Boys meeting in late 2020, court documents indicate, but denied he was a member of the far-right extremist group, saying he \"would have joined the chapter, but it was too far away and there were no members of the Proud Boys in his local area.\"\" (NPR)",

Wilson was a county-level leader of the Oath Keepers based in North Carolina, and he conspired with other members of the group to \"oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power,\" according to a statement of offense Wilson signed and submitted in federal court as part of his guilty plea. In the days and weeks after the November 2020 presidential election, Wilson exchanged messages with other members of the Oath Keepers about how they believed Joe Biden had stolen the election and, as Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes allegedly put it in one message, \"we aren't getting through this without a civil war.\" On Jan. 5, 2021, Wilson drove from North Carolina to a hotel in Vienna, Va., which is near Washington, D.C., and brought with him an \"AR-15-style rifle, a 9-millimeter pistol, approximately 200 rounds of ammunition, body armor, a camouflaged combat uniform, pepper spray, a large walking stick intended for use as a weapon, and a pocketknife,\" court documents state. Some members of the Oath Keepers allegedly remained at the hotel with a stash of weapons in order to act as a \"Quick Reaction Force\" that could bring arms into D.C. \"in case of worst case scenarios,\" as Rhodes reportedly wrote in one message. On the day of the riot, Wilson breached the Capitol and helped force open doors to the building's rotunda, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that at least 14 Oath Keepers breached the Capitol. Wilson left the building and later that evening gathered with Rhodes and other Oath Keepers at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. At one point, court documents state, Rhodes called an unidentified person via speakerphone and \"repeatedly implore[d] the individual to tell President Trump to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer of power.\" The person \"denied Rhodes's request to speak directly with President Trump,\" according to court documents, which do not state what relationship that person may have had to Trump. Afterward, members of the group reportedly had dinner at an Olive Garden restaurant and discussed the possibility of taking further actions to fight the transfer of power. In the days after Jan. 6, Wilson deleted messages and information about the alleged plot and threw his cellphone into the Atlantic Ocean.\" (NPR)",

It is here that Ramey sprayed officers in the eyes with an orange chemical agent, causing disorientation and pain. Though video footage of the incident was captured, the officers were not able to identify the perpetrator of the attack due to the impairment of their vision at the time. Ramey was identified using cell phone location data provided by AT&T--which showed that the phone belonging to Ramey had been using the cell site servicing the U.S. Capitol Building, testimony from the manager of Hilton Arlington Hotel, and identification from a former neighbor. Ramey was then arrested on charges of assaulting police, engaging in physical violence on Capitol grounds, entering a restricted building and civil disorder.",

Russell is a former Florida National Guard member and a founder of Atomwaffen, and Russell lived with Devon Arthurs, another Atomwaffen member arrested in 2017 for murder, but who had similarly planted to attack US electrical sites and nuclear power plants.",

He added that the Proud Boys “seemed like nice people.” When FBI agents interviewed Mellors a second time in May, he said he expected to be arrested and confirmed he brought two canisters of bear spray to Washington.

According to the indictment, in September 2019, Weeden, Tobin, and Barasneh – all members of The Base, a multi-state, white supremacist organization – allegedly used an encrypted messaging platform to discuss vandalizing property associated with African Americans and Jewish Americans. Weeden and his co-conspirators dubbed their plan, “Operation Kristallnacht,” which in German means “Night of Broken Glass” and is in reference to the events that took place on November 9th and 10th of 1938 in which Nazis murdered Jewish people and burned and destroyed their homes, synagogues, schools, and places of business. The indictment alleges that Weeden carried out this plan on September 21, 2019, when he spray-painted swastikas and symbols associated with The Base on the outside walls of Temple Jacob. Weeden is charged with two counts. The first count is for Conspiracy Against Rights under 18 U.S.C. § 241, a civil rights statute that makes it a crime to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in the exercise of their rights...The second count is for Damage to Religious Property under 18 U.S.C. § 247, also a civil rights statute that makes it a crime to intentionally deface, damage, or destroy religious property because of the race or ethnic characteristics of individuals associated with that religious property. The maximum penalty under this statute is 1 year imprisonment and a $100,000 fine...The grand jury issued its two-count indictment against Nathan Weeden on June 27, 2023. The indictment was unsealed on June 29, 2023, after the defendant was arrested by the FBI. He remains in custody at this time.
