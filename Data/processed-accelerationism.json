According to the indictment, Hutaree members view local, state, and federal law enforcement as the \u201cbrotherhood\u201d, their enemy, and have been preparing to engage them in armed conflict. The indictment also alleges that the Hutaree planned to kill an unidentified member of local law enforcement and then attack the law enforcement officers who would gather in Michigan for the funeral. According to the plan, the Hutaree would attack law enforcement vehicles during the funeral procession with improvised explosive devices with explosively formed projectiles, which, according to the indictment, constitute weapons of mass destruction. Subsequently, and in furtherance of this plan, David Brian Stone, the Hutaree\u2019s leader, obtained information about such devices over the Internet and e-mailed diagrams of such devices to a person he believed capable of manufacturing the devices. Additionally all nine defndants were charged with carrying or possessing a firearm during a crime of violence on at least one occasion. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty and were aquitted with the exception of David Brian Stone Sr., Joshua John Clough, and Joshua Matthew Stone who pleaded not guilty and were found guilty on some charges and sentenced to time served of 28 months.",

As @doctorpepper35, Giampa tweeted about his hatred of transgender people and his admiration for Adolf Hitler. He tweeted about using Jews as target practice. Online, Giampa had repeatedly interacted with white supremacist groups, in particular the Atomwaffen Division. The Frickers had staged an intervention for their daughter to keep her from dating an \"outspoken neo-Nazi\" and had even reported Giampa's hate speech to the special education high school the two attended. Initially, Giampa was ruled incompetent to stand trial due to brain damage from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. After spending months in a mental hospital, Giampa was deemed competent to stand trial. Giampa's sentencing is coded as data not available because his records are not available through Fairfax County Circuit Court, and his name has not appeared in the news since 2019.",

Jeffrey and his brother, Edward \"Teddy\" Clark, were active on the social media site Gab, where they were active in Alt-Right forums and in the white nationalist movement, attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, and were identiified as holding a Vanguard America flag in one of their images. They were both \"friends\" with Robert Bowers, the perpetrator of the Tree-of-Life Synagogue attack on October 27th, 2018. On the same day of the attack, Edward Clark took his own life, resulting in an escalation of Jeffrey's radicalized views. Two witnesses reported Jeffrey to the FBI due to his extreme agitation, worried he was a threat to himself and others. The witnesses assisted agents in recovering firearms and AR-15-modifying parts and conversion kits, and informed them of Jeffrey's drug use. In court, Jeffrey plead guilty to the drug charge but not the weapon charge, and was sentenced to time served (10 months) and 36 months of supervised release.",

Court documents say Hasson espoused extremist and white supremacist views and allege that he relied on the manifesto of Anders Breivik, a Norwegian who was convicted in 2011 of two terror attacks that killed 77 people. As detailed in court documents, to prepare himself to take action, in addition to the firearms and silencers referenced above, Hasson purchased holsters, knives, magazines, ammunition, handguards, camping supplies, Meals-Ready-to-Eat, steel body armor plates, plate carriers, tactical vests and pouches, firearm repair kits, and smoke grenades.",

Both men were arrested on June 30, 2018 at a rally hosted by the group Patriot Prayer, which continually clashes with anti-fascist members on the streets of downtown Portland, along with Luiz E. Marquez, and Matthew R. Braddock.. Flippo\u2019s indictment mentions Toese, but at the time of Flippo\u2019s arrest, Toese was not yet in custody. Donovon Flippo was charged with third-degree assault (a class C felony) and fourth-degree assault. Flippo pleaded guilty to fourth-degree assault, a misdemeanor. On 7/17/2019 Donavan was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered him not to participate in any mass protests in Multnomah County. He must complete 40 hours of community service within six months and have no contact with the victim in the case. He also was sentenced to eight days in jail, which he already served after his March arrest in Clark County. After his arrest, Flippo was transferred to Multnomah County and posted bail. On 10/24/2019 he was sentenced to 10 days in jail for probation violation.",

The campaign, allegedly orchestrated by Richard Tobin, was part of a nationwide campaign of racial terror performed by The Base. Barasneh traveled to train with firearms with members of the group, was allegedly involved in a goat sacrifice, and was part of a group that has seen eight arrests from late 2019 to early 2020. Barasneh spray-painted swastikas and anti-Semitic words on Beth Israel Sinai Congregation in Racine last September and plotted other acts of vandalism against minority residents with the hate group, according to a federal criminal complaint. Barasneh's parents immigrated from Jordan, though it is presume that Barasneh is a US citizen. The case was investigated by the JTTF.",

    "narrative": "\"Benjamin Hung, 28, is accused of possessing a machete, a Glock and other weapons in his truck and driving into a crowd of racial justice protesters in Pasadena...[he] was using his family's vineyard as a \"training camp\" to prepare for \"civil disorders\"...was arrested after he accelerated a Dodge Ram adorned with several flags embraced by right-wing extremists and a license plate that read \"WAR R1G\" into a crowd in Pasadena, northeast of downtown Los Angeles. The 150 or so protesters were in the Old Town section of Pasadena on the afternoon of May 31. The agent says the protesters, who were chanting \"Black lives matter here,\" ran out of the way to avoid being hit. After being detained by local police, Hung told authorities that he felt threatened after protesters threw things at his truck, according to the complaint...No evidence corroborated Hung's account, the agent says, and officers who searched his truck found a loaded Glock handgun, a 15-round magazine, a machete, an 18-inch metal pipe, a megaphone and $3,200 in cash...Hung was charged with attempted assault with a deadly weapon in state Superior Court. Court records show that he posted $30,000 bond June 12. An arraignment and plea are scheduled for Tuesday...The complaint alleges that Hung was stockpiling weapons. A photo that authorities said they obtained from his iCloud account that was included in the documents shows assault rifles, semi-automatic pistols, magazines, ammunition, a tactical vest, binoculars, a rifle scope and other equipment. The agents say the guns were likely purchased out of state and kept at the home in San Marino...Hung was charged with illegally acquiring the Glock found in his truck and buying three out-of-state guns that he brought to California.

Bellar, Morrison, and Musico pleaded not guilty and were each sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison. Molitor and both Null brothers pleaded not guilty and were acquitted.",

FBI agents arrested Rankin...and recovered a black semi-automatic rifle during the execution of a search warrant at his residence...According to the criminal complaint, Rankin was in unlawful possession of a firearm, with the capability and means to affect violence in furtherance of his beliefs and has expressed a desire to overthrow the government, specifically, the \u201cthree letter agencies\u201d such as ATF, FBI and IRS...Rankin attempted to purchase two long guns from a San Antonio retail outlet on March 23, 2018, but was denied the firearms transactions under the \u201cProhibited Category\u201d for previously being committed to a mental institution. After being warned by agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that he was a prohibited person, Rankin posted pictures of himself with a firearm on social media. On May 30, 2020, Rankin and others, carrying long guns and pistols, appeared at the Alamo in downtown San Antonio to attend a protest in reaction to the death of George Floyd. The next day, Rankin posted on his Facebook account photos of himself and others carrying a firearm at the protest as well as comments about his disdain for police including, \u201c\u2026hope they burn the precinct down\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m BOOGALOO we hate police.\u201d...on August 4, 2020, Rankin posted a \u201cselfie\u201d photo on his Facebook timeline showing him holding a black, semi-automatic rifle in a vertical position against his shoulder with his finger on the trigger. Rankin posted other photos which included a quote, stating, \u201cDiligently Plotting to Take Over the World in order to Leave You Alone\u201d. On August 11, 2020, Rankin arrived at the airport in Manchester, New Hampshire. He flew out of San Antonio International Airport the previous day. Rankin checked a semiautomatic handgun in his luggage while at the ticket counter, but missed a connecting flight in Philadelphia, PA. Upon his arrival in Manchester, Rankin was met inside the terminal by ATF agents who served Rankin written notice that he is prohibited from possessing firearms. The agents also provided him with copies of his mental health records. Agents seized the handgun and ammunition from inside Rankin\u2019s luggage. Rankin threw the notice letter and mental health records in the trash receptacle before leaving the airport terminal. (DOJ press release)\"",

On May 28, 2020, during a period of rioting near the Third Precinct Building of the Minneapolis Police Department, Hunter fired 13 rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle into the entryway of the building. Following this criminal conduct, Hunter returned to Texas and continued to communicate with his fellow Boogaloo movement members, including Steven Carrillo \u2013 who shot two Protective Services officers at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Oakland, California on the same day as Hunter\u2019s actions in Minneapolis.\" (George Washington University, Program on Extremism)",

According to the SS Indictment, defendants Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were affiliated with the \u201cThree Percenter\u201d movement (sometimes rendered III%), while defendants Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan-based \u201cmilitia\u201d group with similar anti-government views. Ty Garbin entered a guilty plea in January 2020 to the original indictment charging him with conspiracy to kidnap Governor Whitmer and was sentenced to 75 months in prison. In April 2021, a Superseeding Indictment was issued to the five remaining defendants. Harris and Caserta pleaded not guilty and were both acquitted of all charges. Franks pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 48 months in prison. Fox and Croft Jr. pleaded not guilty and were convicted by jury trial in August 2022 of conspiracy to kidnap the governor and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against persons or property. Croft was additionally convicted of knowingly possessing an unregistered destructive device, specifically an improvised explosive wrapped in pennies for shrapnel. Fox was sentenced to 192 months in prison, and Croft was sentenced to 235 months in prison.",

On January 6, Secor entered the Capitol through the Senate doors, entered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, and sat in Vice President Mike Pence's chair on the Senate Floor. He was also charged with assaulting police officers within the Capitol, but this charge and others were later dropped. He made  prior comments about civil war and wrote on his Twitter account that \"We're legit in the Turner Diaries timeline.\" He was a UCLA student at the time of the riot and wore a red Make America Great Again hat and carried an America First flag. \n\n\"The FBI said Secor is a self-identified Groyper, a network of \"alt right figures who are vocal supporters of white supremacist and 'America First' podcaster Nick Fuentes. The FBI stated a tipster reported Secor founded the campus organization \"America First Bruins\" and is a member of Bruins Republicans. The FBI stated Secor can be seen in a group of rioters pushing their way into the building. Court documents state a tipster told the FBI that Secor moved back in with his mother after the riot, got rid of his phone and car and bragged that he would not be caught for his involvement.\" (USA Today)",

That coworker then called the FBI to turn him in. In an initial interview with the FBI, Watson said he had participated in the Jan. 6 rally but denied being inside the Capitol building. In a second interview with agents, the FBI seized Watson's cellphone, and he admitted that he had entered the building. On that seized phone, law enforcement found photos from inside and outside the building and texts sent shortly after the riot, one of which read \"I was one of the people that helped storm the capitol building and smash out the windows . We made history today. Proudest day of my life!\u201d According to local news reports, Watson\u2019s home is covered with messages, including \u201cCOVID1984,\" \u201cDemocrats stole the election\" and \"Veterans for Trump.\" NPR was not able to confirm his military history.\" (NPR)",

Ahead of the Capitol riot, court documents state, Grods joined a group chat named on the encrypted messaging app Signal called \"DC OP: Jan 6 21.\" Grods \"brought firearms to Washington, D.C., and eventually provided them to another individual to store in a Virginia hotel,\" while Grods stayed with other members of the group at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C., prosecutors say. While the Capitol riot was ongoing, Grods allegedly rode in a golf cart with others members of the Oath Keepers to the Capitol, then breached the building while carrying what prosecutors describe as a \"large stick.\" Soon after, Grods exited the building as law enforcement used pepper balls to try to force people out of the Capitol, the court documents state. Later, he allegedly met with other members of the Oath Keepers outside the Capitol building, and, in the days after the riot, said he had deleted his messages on Signal. As part of a plea agreement, Grods has agreed to testify in court and sit for interviews with investigators.\" (NPR)",

He was dubbed #TartanPlaidPB by online sleuths who are researching those who participated in the Capitol riot, then turning that information over to the FBI. Jackson is seen in photos numerous times on Jan. 6 with Proud Boys from Arizona, and wore one of their orange arm bands, the FBI stated. However, in an interview with the FBI at his home, agents said Jackson told them he is not affiliated with the Proud Boys and doesn't support their ideology. He said they gave him the orange band and he stayed with them for protection because he had traveled to Washington, D.C. alone. However, the FBI noted that in December, one of his social media connections tagged him in a post about a group of Proud Boys being in New York City. In a social media post included in the court records, Jackson said he didn't agree with the \"MAGA tribalism,\" and didn't commit any violence. Jackson stated in the post that he had evidence of BLM, Antifa, police officers and \"Non Trump\" extremists \"causing the mayhem.\" Jackson also stated that he's a college student studying to be a political science professor. \"My only love is the United States of America,\" he wrote. At the Capitol, records show he carried a U.S. flag and was with a crowd singing The Star-Spangled Banner after the detonation of an explosive device in the crowd. He then pointed toward the Senate Wing of the Capitol and moved that direction. The agents noted he was seen on video in Statuary Hall and other locations inside the Capitol.\" (USA Today)",

According to court records, Bergstrom is a \u201cself proclaimed Boogaloo Boi\u201d who was initially arrested at a Greyhound Bus Station in Phoenix, Arizona in January 2021. Bergstrom\u2019s initial arrest was based on probable cause that he committed felony misconduct involving weapons, in violation of Arizona criminal code. After being released, Bergstrom failed to appear for his preliminary hearing, and a bench warrant was subsequently issued for his arrest. On March 13, 2021, Bergstrom was identified by the FBI as a participant in an event in Louisville, Kentucky, which was attended by multiple adherents of the Boogaloo movement. During the event, Bergstrom was arrested by law enforcement, who discovered a handgun on his person. A search warrant for Bergstrom\u2019s cell phone also revealed screen shots of a pair of Greyhound bus tickets from New Mexico to Ohio, purchased under aliases, in an attempt to conceal Bergstrom\u2019s identity and flee Arizona to avoid prosecution.\"",

    "narrative": "\"David Dempsey came to the attention of federal investigators through public tips from the Sedition Hunters -- people researching the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. On the day of the Capitol riot, federal prosecutors allege, Dempsey wore an American flag-themed neck gaiter as well as a combat-style helmet, camouflage pants and a tactical vest. In one video described in court documents, Dempsey stood in front of a gallows erected outside the Capitol and said that Democrats in Congress \"need to hang from these motherf****** [pointing to gallows],\" and that \"Hopefully one day soon we really have someone hanging from one of these motherf******.\" During the riot, Dempsey allegedly used a lacrimal agent -- such as pepper spray -- as well as a crutch and a metal pole to attack police officers guarding the Capitol building. Dempsey was arrested in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2019 over allegedly using bear spray to attack anti-Trump protesters there. Dempsey pleaded no contest to a charge stemming from that incident. The Justice Department notes in its court filings that Dempsey can be seen in multiple photos from Jan. 6 wearing a black- and yellow-colored bracelet. Black and yellow are the colors associated with the far-right extremist group known as the Proud Boys. In one photo described in court documents, Dempsey made the OK sign while standing next to people wearing Proud Boys attire. The \"OK\" sign, which the Proud Boys frequently use, is often associated with supporters of white supremacy, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Dempsey was arrested on Aug. 26.\" (NPR)",

    "narrative": "Joshua Dillion Haynes, 39 of Virginia, pled guilty to Obstruction of an Official Proceeding and Destruction of Property in the Territorial Jurisdiction. He was sentenced to 32 months in prison for his role in the Capitol Raid. He was recorded on video attacking members of the media at a staging area near the Capitol, crushing their equipment and stealing their camera. According to local news reporting, Haynes was angry specifically at CNN. \"Court documents also show images taken from another video that allegedly show Haynes, along with two others, attempting to pull an air conditioning unit from outside the Capitol building. Haynes was identified by a tipster who used publicly available facial recognition software to match images from photos with a post from a Parler profile, and agents subsequently pulled the subscriber records to find a phone number and email address. Search warrant records for the phone reportedly show that Haynes used it the day of the riot to take pictures inside the Capitol and at the media staging area, and to text with friends. One selfie depicted Haynes inside the office of a U.S. senator, court documents indicate. Later, texts were allegedly exchanged between Haynes and other individuals that indicated he had broken windows and crawled into the Capitol. Prosecutors say one friend texted Haynes the message \u201cdont [sic] be like antifa tearing stuff up.\u201d Haynes replied, \u201cahhhh tooooo late,\u201d \u201cbroke lotsa stuff,\u201d and then \u201clol.\u201d Haynes reportedly indicated he was seen destroying media equipment, saying \"i Kicked the fake news a**\" and \"I am in the video destroying stuff but I'm wearing a mask.\" FBI agents went to Haynes' house and interviewed him at length. Haynes allegedly said he believed riot suspects were being treated badly in contrast to people who had participated in Black Lives Matter protests and that he respected those who used force against law enforcement to \"stop the election from being stolen.\" Haynes attended a Proud Boys meeting in late 2020, court documents indicate, but denied he was a member of the far-right extremist group, saying he \"would have joined the chapter, but it was too far away and there were no members of the Proud Boys in his local area.\"\" (NPR)",

Spain was then charged with Entering and Remaining in a Restricted Building or Grounds; Disorderly and Disruptive Conduct in a Restricted Building or Grounds; Disorderly Conduct in a Capitol Building; Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building following his participation in the Capitol riot.

Goodwyn is a member of the politically-violent extremist group known as the Proud Boys, which was known to be prevalent and active in the siege of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. In the months leading up to it, Goodwyn made several declarations over social media that signaled his affiliation with them as well as his support for the objections to the results of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election that catalyzed the gathering of protesters at the U.S. Capitol that day. After this information was collected, Goodwyn was arrested and charged.",

Homer added a camouflage helmet and googles to her tactical vest before entering the Capitol, where subpoenaed phone records indicate she remained for over an hour. Homer has posted a Proud Boys emblem to her social media, as well as photos taken at the Proud Boys\u2019 Million MAGA March in Washington, D.C., in November 2020, according to the statement of facts. She was arrested on Nov. 26, 2021, in Colorado Springs, Colo. (NPR)",

    "narrative": "Federal prosecutors allege that Ronald Loehrke took part in the U.S. Capitol riot along with another man from the Seattle area named James Haffner. According to documents filed in federal court, Loehrke communicated in December 2020 with Ethan Nordean, a leader of the extremist group the Proud Boys who is facing conspiracy charges connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Nordean allegedly told Loehrke that he wanted Loehrke \"on the front line\" with him on Jan. 6, 2021. Loehrke allegedly agreed and said he was bringing three \"Bad mother f******\" with him to Washington, D.C. On the day of the attack, prosecutors say, Loehrke and Haffner marched with members and associates of the Proud Boys toward the Capitol. They then allegedly dismantled barriers protecting the outside of the Capitol building. When a line of police protecting the outside of the Capitol stopped people from advancing farther, Loehrke allegedly said, \"Don't back down, patriots! The whole f****** world is watching. Stand the f*** up today!\" At one point, Haffner allegedly used an aerosol spray against an officer with the U.S. Capitol Police guarding an outer door. Soon after, prosecutors say, Haffner, Loehrke and other rioters were able to breach the building through that door and can be seen in video footage taken inside the building. Ronald Loehrke was arrested in Cumming, Ga., on Dec. 3, 2021. (NPR)",

Giddings is charged with two other men, Brian Healion and Freedom Vy, who were allegedly part of a Telegram message group with Rehl and another person who was not in Washington, D.C., on the day of the insurrection. The group coordinated travel from Philadelphia to D.C. ahead of Jan. 6, 2021, and Giddings, Healion and Vy stayed together at The Darcy hotel in D.C. on the night before the riot, according to court records. On the day of the riot, Giddings allegedly appeared in a photograph outside the U.S. Capitol with Rehl and others, all flashing the \"OK\" hand symbol, a gesture associated with the Proud Boys. The four men then allegedly entered the Capitol building, where the four of them appear in several photos and videos. In a reply to a text the next day asking how they were doing, Giddings allegedly wrote: \u201cYes we have everything and everyone all accounted for ... none of our Philly guys had any PB gear the entire event just plain trump supporters from beginning to end.\" According to news reports, the Proud Boys were directed not to wear their signature black and yellow on the day of the riot, aiming to blend in with other Trump supporters.

The group of rioters collectively pushed against officers, at times rocking together in a coordinated way, to gain entry to the interior of the building. He remained in this area for a period of more than 45 minutes. Later, according to the court documents, Fischer moved to the west front of the Capitol.

In reply, Portlock allegedly gestured to the crowd surrounding him and said \u201cI can\u2019t with this.\" He then pleaded with officers to help a fellow rioter having a medical emergency and continued preventing police from closing doors into the Capitol building, according to the statement. Just a half-hour or so before that, FBI agents allege that Portlock pushed open metal barricades and used a large sheet of plywood to drive back a line of police officers in front of the Capitol. Portlock allegedly also joined a crowd of other protesters, chanting \u201cheave-ho\u201d and passing Capitol Police riot shields to other protesters in an attempt to push past officers blocking access to the tunnel into the Capitol. Portlock is a manager with Mitsubishi Motors, according to a LinkedIn page referenced in the FBI statement of facts. Court records show he was arrested on Nov. 3 in Smyrna, Tenn.\" (NPR)",

    "narrative": "\"William Todd Wilson is the third member of the Oath Keepers, an anti-government extremist group, to plead guilty to a charge of seditious conspiracy and agree to cooperate with the government's investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Wilson was a county-level leader of the Oath Keepers based in North Carolina, and he conspired with other members of the group to \"oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power,\" according to a statement of offense Wilson signed and submitted in federal court as part of his guilty plea. In the days and weeks after the November 2020 presidential election, Wilson exchanged messages with other members of the Oath Keepers about how they believed Joe Biden had stolen the election and, as Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes allegedly put it in one message, \"we aren't getting through this without a civil war.\" On Jan. 5, 2021, Wilson drove from North Carolina to a hotel in Vienna, Va., which is near Washington, D.C., and brought with him an \"AR-15-style rifle, a 9-millimeter pistol, approximately 200 rounds of ammunition, body armor, a camouflaged combat uniform, pepper spray, a large walking stick intended for use as a weapon, and a pocketknife,\" court documents state. Some members of the Oath Keepers allegedly remained at the hotel with a stash of weapons in order to act as a \"Quick Reaction Force\" that could bring arms into D.C. \"in case of worst case scenarios,\" as Rhodes reportedly wrote in one message. On the day of the riot, Wilson breached the Capitol and helped force open doors to the building's rotunda, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that at least 14 Oath Keepers breached the Capitol. Wilson left the building and later that evening gathered with Rhodes and other Oath Keepers at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. At one point, court documents state, Rhodes called an unidentified person via speakerphone and \"repeatedly implore[d] the individual to tell President Trump to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer of power.\" The person \"denied Rhodes's request to speak directly with President Trump,\" according to court documents, which do not state what relationship that person may have had to Trump. Afterward, members of the group reportedly had dinner at an Olive Garden restaurant and discussed the possibility of taking further actions to fight the transfer of power. In the days after Jan. 6, Wilson deleted messages and information about the alleged plot and threw his cellphone into the Atlantic Ocean.\" (NPR)",

A member of the Proud Boys, Ramey came into conflict with U.S. Capitol Police officers on the west side of the building; he was part of the mob pushing against the officers attempting to stop them from climbing the stairwell from the Lower West Terrace to the Upper West Terrace. It is here that Ramey sprayed officers in the eyes with an orange chemical agent, causing disorientation and pain. Though video footage of the incident was captured, the officers were not able to identify the perpetrator of the attack due to the impairment of their vision at the time. Ramey was identified using cell phone location data provided by AT&T--which showed that the phone belonging to Ramey had been using the cell site servicing the U.S. Capitol Building, testimony from the manager of Hilton Arlington Hotel, and identification from a former neighbor. Ramey was then arrested on charges of assaulting police, engaging in physical violence on Capitol grounds, entering a restricted building and civil disorder.",

He also worked as a defense contractor conducting \"advanced analysis for the DOD\" and other federal agencies. Speed is charged with his connection to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. IN conversations with an undercover FBI agent, Speed expressed anti-government, anti-semitic positions including opposition to BLM and anti-fascists, and plans to attack members of the ADL. He praised domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph and the so-called Unabomber, and spoke of browsing Telegram as a source of radicalization. He blamed antifascists for breaching the Capitol. He claimed to have been present at the Capitol with friends who were Proud Boys, and although it does not appear he was a 'patched' member, he at times claimed affiliation with the Proud Boys.",

According to the indictment, in September 2019, Weeden, Tobin, and Barasneh \u2013 all members of The Base, a multi-state, white supremacist organization \u2013 allegedly used an encrypted messaging platform to discuss vandalizing property associated with African Americans and Jewish Americans. Weeden and his co-conspirators dubbed their plan, \u201cOperation Kristallnacht,\u201d which in German means \u201cNight of Broken Glass\u201d and is in reference to the events that took place on November 9th and 10th of 1938 in which Nazis murdered Jewish people and burned and destroyed their homes, synagogues, schools, and places of business.
