The indictment also alleges that the Hutaree planned to kill an unidentified member of local law enforcement and then attack the law enforcement officers who would gather in Michigan for the funeral. According to the plan, the Hutaree would attack law enforcement vehicles during the funeral procession with improvised explosive devices with explosively formed projectiles, which, according to the indictment, constitute weapons of mass destruction. Subsequently, and in furtherance of this plan, David Brian Stone, the Hutaree’s leader, obtained information about such devices over the Internet and e-mailed diagrams of such devices to a person he believed capable of manufacturing the devices. Additionally all nine defndants were charged with carrying or possessing a firearm during a crime of violence on at least one occasion.

Russell and his roommate Devon Arthurs (the shooter) were co-founders of the Atomwaffen Division. Russell was not found to be connected to the murder of his roommates. The bomb-making materials were found amongst other neo-Nazi propaganda, including a framed picture of Timothy McVeigh and the Turner Diaries. Russell's attorney argues that Russell has mental deficiencies (ADHD and Autism) and that the bomb-makng materials were not going to be used.

This was carried out by Giampa sneaking into his girlfriends home, when her parents discovered him, he drew a handgun and shot both parents before unsuccessfully attempting suicide by shooting himself. As @doctorpepper35, Giampa tweeted about his hatred of transgender people and his admiration for Adolf Hitler. He tweeted about using Jews as target practice. Online, Giampa had repeatedly interacted with white supremacist groups, in particular the Atomwaffen Division. The Frickers had staged an intervention for their daughter to keep her from dating an \"outspoken neo-Nazi\" and had even reported Giampa's hate speech to the special education high school the two attended. Initially, Giampa was ruled incompetent to stand trial due to brain damage from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. After spending months in a mental hospital, Giampa was deemed competent to stand trial. Giampa's sentencing is coded as data not available because his records are not available through Fairfax County Circuit Court, and his name has not appeared in the news since 2019.",

The prosecutors demonstrated that Woodward had troves of homophobic and neo-Nazi material on his mobile phone, as well as an active affiliation to Atomwaffen Division. Woodward was reportedly sexually confused and had a habit of \"pranking\" gay men on dating apps. Woodward met up with Bernstein and, when Bernstein tried to kiss him, stabbed him repeatedly in the neck. Because of the attack on Bernstein due to his sexuality, Woodward will receive a hate crime enhancement in sentencing.",

Jeffrey and his brother, Edward \"Teddy\" Clark, were active on the social media site Gab, where they were active in Alt-Right forums and in the white nationalist movement, attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, and were identiified as holding a Vanguard America flag in one of their images. They were both \"friends\" with Robert Bowers, the perpetrator of the Tree-of-Life Synagogue attack on October 27th, 2018. On the same day of the attack, Edward Clark took his own life, resulting in an escalation of Jeffrey's radicalized views. Two witnesses reported Jeffrey to the FBI due to his extreme agitation, worried he was a threat to himself and others. The witnesses assisted agents in recovering firearms and AR-15-modifying parts and conversion kits, and informed them of Jeffrey's drug use. In court, Jeffrey plead guilty to the drug charge but not the weapon charge, and was sentenced to time served (10 months) and 36 months of supervised release.",

As they exited the event, Hare, Kinsman and others from their group taunted members of antifa and made verbal and nonverbal threats, prosecutors said. Antifa protesters later intercepted Hare, Kinsman, and at least eight other Proud Boys, where the defendants charged at them and a dispute ensued, according to prosecutors. Hare, Kinsman and others then assaulted four antifa members, striking them with their hands, fists, feet, elbows and boots until NYPD officers arrived, prosecutors said.",

As detailed in court documents, to prepare himself to take action, in addition to the firearms and silencers referenced above, Hasson purchased holsters, knives, magazines, ammunition, handguards, camping supplies, Meals-Ready-to-Eat, steel body armor plates, plate carriers, tactical vests and pouches, firearm repair kits, and smoke grenades.",

Both men were arrested on June 30, 2018 at a rally hosted by the group Patriot Prayer, which continually clashes with anti-fascist members on the streets of downtown Portland, along with Luiz E. Marquez, and Matthew R. Braddock.. Flippo’s indictment mentions Toese, but at the time of Flippo’s arrest, Toese was not yet in custody. Donovon Flippo was charged with third-degree assault (a class C felony) and fourth-degree assault. Flippo pleaded guilty to fourth-degree assault, a misdemeanor. On 7\/17\/2019 Donavan was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered him not to participate in any mass protests in Multnomah County. He must complete 40 hours of community service within six months and have no contact with the victim in the case. He also was sentenced to eight days in jail, which he already served after his March arrest in Clark County. After his arrest, Flippo was transferred to Multnomah County and posted bail. On 10\/24\/2019 he was sentenced to 10 days in jail for probation violation.",

He committed these crimes from November 2018 to to February 2019. The defendant is affiliated with the Attomwaffen Division and allegedly selected targets that were African Americans and Jews. During the course of the conspiracy Kelly conspired with John Cameron Denton, a former Atomwaffen leader, to conduct \"swatting\" calls. As a former Old Dominion University student he instructed other conspirators to swat the university and call in a bomb threat. During the course of the conspiracy members placed at least 134 swatting calls to jurisdictions across the country.",

The 150 or so protesters were in the Old Town section of Pasadena on the afternoon of May 31. The agent says the protesters, who were chanting \"Black lives matter here,\" ran out of the way to avoid being hit. After being detained by local police, Hung told authorities that he felt threatened after protesters threw things at his truck, according to the complaint...No evidence corroborated Hung's account, the agent says, and officers who searched his truck found a loaded Glock handgun, a 15-round magazine, a machete, an 18-inch metal pipe, a megaphone and $3,200 in cash...Hung was charged with attempted assault with a deadly weapon in state Superior Court. Court records show that he posted $30,000 bond June 12. An arraignment and plea are scheduled for Tuesday...The complaint alleges that Hung was stockpiling weapons. A photo that authorities said they obtained from his iCloud account that was included in the documents shows assault rifles, semi-automatic pistols, magazines, ammunition, a tactical vest, binoculars, a rifle scope and other equipment. The agents say the guns were likely purchased out of state and kept at the home in San Marino...Hung was charged with illegally acquiring the Glock found in his truck and buying three out-of-state guns that he brought to California.

Bellar, Morrison, and Musico pleaded not guilty and were each sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison. Molitor and both Null brothers pleaded not guilty and were acquitted.",

FBI agents arrested Rankin...and recovered a black semi-automatic rifle during the execution of a search warrant at his residence...According to the criminal complaint, Rankin was in unlawful possession of a firearm, with the capability and means to affect violence in furtherance of his beliefs and has expressed a desire to overthrow the government, specifically, the “three letter agencies” such as ATF, FBI and IRS...Rankin attempted to purchase two long guns from a San Antonio retail outlet on March 23, 2018, but was denied the firearms transactions under the “Prohibited Category” for previously being committed to a mental institution. After being warned by agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that he was a prohibited person, Rankin posted pictures of himself with a firearm on social media. On May 30, 2020, Rankin and others, carrying long guns and pistols, appeared at the Alamo in downtown San Antonio to attend a protest in reaction to the death of George Floyd. The next day, Rankin posted on his Facebook account photos of himself and others carrying a firearm at the protest as well as comments about his disdain for police including, “…hope they burn the precinct down” and “I’m BOOGALOO we hate police.”...on August 4, 2020, Rankin posted a “selfie” photo on his Facebook timeline showing him holding a black, semi-automatic rifle in a vertical position against his shoulder with his finger on the trigger. Rankin posted other photos which included a quote, stating, “Diligently Plotting to Take Over the World in order to Leave You Alone”. On August 11, 2020, Rankin arrived at the airport in Manchester, New Hampshire. He flew out of San Antonio International Airport the previous day. Rankin checked a semiautomatic handgun in his luggage while at the ticket counter, but missed a connecting flight in Philadelphia, PA. Upon his arrival in Manchester, Rankin was met inside the terminal by ATF agents who served Rankin written notice that he is prohibited from possessing firearms. The agents also provided him with copies of his mental health records. Agents seized the handgun and ammunition from inside Rankin’s luggage. Rankin threw the notice letter and mental health records in the trash receptacle before leaving the airport terminal. (DOJ press release)\"",

Hunter, an adherent of the Boogaloo movement, traveled from Texas to Minnesota in May 2020 and met up with other Boogaloo movement members who had mobilized to Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd. On May 28, 2020, during a period of rioting near the Third Precinct Building of the Minneapolis Police Department, Hunter fired 13 rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle into the entryway of the building. Following this criminal conduct, Hunter returned to Texas and continued to communicate with his fellow Boogaloo movement members, including Steven Carrillo – who shot two Protective Services officers at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Oakland, California on the same day as Hunter’s actions in Minneapolis.\" (George Washington University, Program on Extremism)",

The men trained together and then planned to kidnap Governor Whitmer before the November 2020 Election. According to the SS Indictment, defendants Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were affiliated with the “Three Percenter” movement (sometimes rendered III%), while defendants Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan-based “militia” group with similar anti-government views. Ty Garbin entered a guilty plea in January 2020 to the original indictment charging him with conspiracy to kidnap Governor Whitmer and was sentenced to 75 months in prison. In April 2021, a Superseeding Indictment was issued to the five remaining defendants. Harris and Caserta pleaded not guilty and were both acquitted of all charges. Franks pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 48 months in prison. Fox and Croft Jr. pleaded not guilty and were convicted by jury trial in August 2022 of conspiracy to kidnap the governor and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against persons or property. Croft was additionally convicted of knowingly possessing an unregistered destructive device, specifically an improvised explosive wrapped in pennies for shrapnel. Fox was sentenced to 192 months in prison, and Croft was sentenced to 235 months in prison.",

On January 6, Secor entered the Capitol through the Senate doors, entered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, and sat in Vice President Mike Pence's chair on the Senate Floor. He was also charged with assaulting police officers within the Capitol, but this charge and others were later dropped. He made  prior comments about civil war and wrote on his Twitter account that \"We're legit in the Turner Diaries timeline.\" He was a UCLA student at the time of the riot and wore a red Make America Great Again hat and carried an America First flag. \n\n\"The FBI said Secor is a self-identified Groyper, a network of \"alt right figures who are vocal supporters of white supremacist and 'America First' podcaster Nick Fuentes. The FBI stated a tipster reported Secor founded the campus organization \"America First Bruins\" and is a member of Bruins Republicans. The FBI stated Secor can be seen in a group of rioters pushing their way into the building. Court documents state a tipster told the FBI that Secor moved back in with his mother after the riot, got rid of his phone and car and bragged that he would not be caught for his involvement.\" (USA Today)",

On Jan. 4, Bennett posted a conspiracy-laden message, including his belief that President Joe Biden stole the election and Hunter Biden’s laptop....On Jan. 11, Bennett admitted to federal agents that he went to D.C. and “that he knew it was wrong” to storm the Capitol.

        "Short narrative":"Jessie Alexander Rush, the founder, \"commanding officer,\" and \"major\" of the \"1st Detachment, 1st California Grizzly Scouts\" militia group, was alleged to have purposefully impeded the federal investigation and trial of Steven Carrillo, a Grizzly Scouts member who murdered a federal Protective Service Officer (PSO) in Oakland, California. Rush and his codefendants were charged with Conspiracy to Destroy Records in Official Proceedings for conspiring to destroy communication records relating to the murder. The Facebook group’s description stated, “they say the west won’t boog,” a reference to the “boogaloo” movement. The indictment alleged that a member of the Grizzly Scouts exchanged messages on the WhatsApp group with other Grizzly Scouts, in which that member allegedly told the group that he was preparing to engage in a shoot-out with law enforcement. Rush immediately instructed the Grizzly Scout member on the WhatsApp group to delete evidence on his phone. Rush, Blancas, Ybarra and Miksch then deleted records of their Whatsapp group, including the prior discussions regarding violence against law enforcement and Carrillo’s message to the group—“Dudes i offed a fed” indicating that he had killed a federal law enforcement officer. The indictment also alleges that less than an hour after the shooting in Ben Lomond, Blancas deleted files related to the Grizzly Scouts from a Dropbox account. Further, within hours of the shooting, members of the Grizzly Scouts, including Rush, Blancas, Ybarra, and Miksch allegedly began to reconnect on an alternative communications application. Moreover, the indictment alleges that the four defendants each deleted records of the WhatsApp group communications from their phones, including the prior discussions regarding violence against law enforcement. Rush pleaded guilty to Conspiracy to Destroy Records in Official Proceedings and was sentenced to 6 months in prison.",

While the Capitol riot was ongoing, Grods allegedly rode in a golf cart with others members of the Oath Keepers to the Capitol, then breached the building while carrying what prosecutors describe as a \"large stick.\" Soon after, Grods exited the building as law enforcement used pepper balls to try to force people out of the Capitol, the court documents state. Later, he allegedly met with other members of the Oath Keepers outside the Capitol building, and, in the days after the riot, said he had deleted his messages on Signal. As part of a plea agreement, Grods has agreed to testify in court and sit for interviews with investigators.\" (NPR)",

        "Short narrative":"\"Jackson, whose social media pages say he's a 100% disabled Marine, surrendered to the FBI on May 18: The FBI stated in court documents that he posted photos on social media of himself on Jan. 6 in a plaid shirt and other clothing he wore to the riot, photos agents later used to identify him. He was dubbed #TartanPlaidPB by online sleuths who are researching those who participated in the Capitol riot, then turning that information over to the FBI. Jackson is seen in photos numerous times on Jan. 6 with Proud Boys from Arizona, and wore one of their orange arm bands, the FBI stated. However, in an interview with the FBI at his home, agents said Jackson told them he is not affiliated with the Proud Boys and doesn't support their ideology. He said they gave him the orange band and he stayed with them for protection because he had traveled to Washington, D.C. alone. However, the FBI noted that in December, one of his social media connections tagged him in a post about a group of Proud Boys being in New York City. In a social media post included in the court records, Jackson said he didn't agree with the \"MAGA tribalism,\" and didn't commit any violence. Jackson stated in the post that he had evidence of BLM, Antifa, police officers and \"Non Trump\" extremists \"causing the mayhem.\" Jackson also stated that he's a college student studying to be a political science professor. \"My only love is the United States of America,\" he wrote. At the Capitol, records show he carried a U.S. flag and was with a crowd singing The Star-Spangled Banner after the detonation of an explosive device in the crowd. He then pointed toward the Senate Wing of the Capitol and moved that direction. The agents noted he was seen on video in Statuary Hall and other locations inside the Capitol.\" (USA Today)",

He was sentenced to 60 months of incarceration. He self-identifies as a Proud Boy member and wore a black ballistic vest, goggles, and a carabiner on his vest into the Capitol. He \"has a tattoo of the organization on his left arm, according to the FBI. In a Wall Street Journal video from Jan. 6, Scott is seen walking alongside known members of the Proud Boys in Washington, D.C. On the same video, a man is heard screaming: “Let’s take the f***ing Capitol.” Another individual then answers: “Let’s not f***ing yell that, all right?” Ethan Nordean, one of the most powerful leaders in the organization, then responds: “It was Milkshake, man, you know … idiot.” Later at the Capitol, additional footage from various sources shows Scott pushing two police officers backward up the steps. Scott appears to be one of the first people to initiate contact with law enforcement and is seen later pulling officers into the crowd.\" (NPR)",

Bergstrom, a 42-year-old resident of Arizona, was sentenced in the Western District of Kentucky to time served after pleading guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm. According to court records, Bergstrom is a “self proclaimed Boogaloo Boi” who was initially arrested at a Greyhound Bus Station in Phoenix, Arizona in January 2021. Bergstrom’s initial arrest was based on probable cause that he committed felony misconduct involving weapons, in violation of Arizona criminal code. After being released, Bergstrom failed to appear for his preliminary hearing, and a bench warrant was subsequently issued for his arrest. On March 13, 2021, Bergstrom was identified by the FBI as a participant in an event in Louisville, Kentucky, which was attended by multiple adherents of the Boogaloo movement. During the event, Bergstrom was arrested by law enforcement, who discovered a handgun on his person. A search warrant for Bergstrom’s cell phone also revealed screen shots of a pair of Greyhound bus tickets from New Mexico to Ohio, purchased under aliases, in an attempt to conceal Bergstrom’s identity and flee Arizona to avoid prosecution.\"",

        "Short narrative":"\"David Dempsey came to the attention of federal investigators through public tips from the Sedition Hunters -- people researching the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. On the day of the Capitol riot, federal prosecutors allege, Dempsey wore an American flag-themed neck gaiter as well as a combat-style helmet, camouflage pants and a tactical vest. In one video described in court documents, Dempsey stood in front of a gallows erected outside the Capitol and said that Democrats in Congress \"need to hang from these motherf****** [pointing to gallows],\" and that \"Hopefully one day soon we really have someone hanging from one of these motherf******.\" During the riot, Dempsey allegedly used a lacrimal agent -- such as pepper spray -- as well as a crutch and a metal pole to attack police officers guarding the Capitol building. Dempsey was arrested in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2019 over allegedly using bear spray to attack anti-Trump protesters there. Dempsey pleaded no contest to a charge stemming from that incident. The Justice Department notes in its court filings that Dempsey can be seen in multiple photos from Jan. 6 wearing a black- and yellow-colored bracelet. Black and yellow are the colors associated with the far-right extremist group known as the Proud Boys. In one photo described in court documents, Dempsey made the OK sign while standing next to people wearing Proud Boys attire. The \"OK\" sign, which the Proud Boys frequently use, is often associated with supporters of white supremacy, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Dempsey was arrested on Aug. 26.\" (NPR)",

        "Short narrative":"Joshua Dillion Haynes, 39 of Virginia, pled guilty to Obstruction of an Official Proceeding and Destruction of Property in the Territorial Jurisdiction. He was sentenced to 32 months in prison for his role in the Capitol Raid. He was recorded on video attacking members of the media at a staging area near the Capitol, crushing their equipment and stealing their camera. According to local news reporting, Haynes was angry specifically at CNN. \"Court documents also show images taken from another video that allegedly show Haynes, along with two others, attempting to pull an air conditioning unit from outside the Capitol building. Haynes was identified by a tipster who used publicly available facial recognition software to match images from photos with a post from a Parler profile, and agents subsequently pulled the subscriber records to find a phone number and email address. Search warrant records for the phone reportedly show that Haynes used it the day of the riot to take pictures inside the Capitol and at the media staging area, and to text with friends. One selfie depicted Haynes inside the office of a U.S. senator, court documents indicate. Later, texts were allegedly exchanged between Haynes and other individuals that indicated he had broken windows and crawled into the Capitol. Prosecutors say one friend texted Haynes the message “dont [sic] be like antifa tearing stuff up.” Haynes replied, “ahhhh tooooo late,” “broke lotsa stuff,” and then “lol.” Haynes reportedly indicated he was seen destroying media equipment, saying \"i Kicked the fake news a**\" and \"I am in the video destroying stuff but I'm wearing a mask.\" FBI agents went to Haynes' house and interviewed him at length. Haynes allegedly said he believed riot suspects were being treated badly in contrast to people who had participated in Black Lives Matter protests and that he respected those who used force against law enforcement to \"stop the election from being stolen.\" Haynes attended a Proud Boys meeting in late 2020, court documents indicate, but denied he was a member of the far-right extremist group, saying he \"would have joined the chapter, but it was too far away and there were no members of the Proud Boys in his local area.\"\" (NPR)",

The extremist Boogaloo movement anticipates a second civil war in America, and some adherents even seek to bring about that conflict. “Ahh nothing like a new pair of 511’s and fresh set of level IV SAPI’s in the plate carrier to go “peacefully protest” with, the caption to the picture read, referring to a high-level ballistic body armor plate, Thurlow had allegedly purchased. According to the FBI, Thurlow served in the Army from 1988 until 1991. A second witness told the FBI that Thurlow had become something of a “conspiracy theorist” after joining the military. Inside the Capitol building, photos show Thurlow lying on what appears to be a conference room table. He is also seen walking around the hallways recording on his cellphone, wearing a camouflage jacket, a yellow scarf and white rimmed sunglasses.\"\"(NPR) He served in the US Army 101st Airborne 1988-1991, served abroad in Saudia Arabia for 6 months in 1990.

Goodwyn is a member of the politically-violent extremist group known as the Proud Boys, which was known to be prevalent and active in the siege of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. In the months leading up to it, Goodwyn made several declarations over social media that signaled his affiliation with them as well as his support for the objections to the results of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election that catalyzed the gathering of protesters at the U.S. Capitol that day. After this information was collected, Goodwyn was arrested and charged.",

        "Short narrative":"Federal prosecutors allege that Ronald Loehrke took part in the U.S. Capitol riot along with another man from the Seattle area named James Haffner. According to documents filed in federal court, Loehrke communicated in December 2020 with Ethan Nordean, a leader of the extremist group the Proud Boys who is facing conspiracy charges connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Nordean allegedly told Loehrke that he wanted Loehrke \"on the front line\" with him on Jan. 6, 2021. Loehrke allegedly agreed and said he was bringing three \"Bad mother f******\" with him to Washington, D.C. On the day of the attack, prosecutors say, Loehrke and Haffner marched with members and associates of the Proud Boys toward the Capitol. They then allegedly dismantled barriers protecting the outside of the Capitol building. When a line of police protecting the outside of the Capitol stopped people from advancing farther, Loehrke allegedly said, \"Don't back down, patriots! The whole f****** world is watching. Stand the f*** up today!\" At one point, Haffner allegedly used an aerosol spray against an officer with the U.S. Capitol Police guarding an outer door. Soon after, prosecutors say, Haffner, Loehrke and other rioters were able to breach the building through that door and can be seen in video footage taken inside the building. Ronald Loehrke was arrested in Cumming, Ga., on Dec. 3, 2021. (NPR)",

Vy is charged with Brian Healion and Isaiah Giddings, who were all allegedly part of a Telegram message with Rehl and one other unidentified person who was not in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021. The group members coordinated their travel from Philadelphia to D.C., including sharing contact information and blood types, and Giddings, Healion and Vy stayed together at The Darcy hotel in D.C. on Jan. 5, 2021, according to court records. On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Vy and Healion took a selfie together at the Washington Monument.

        "Short narrative":"Law enforcement allegedly identified Isaiah Giddings as a person who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot after searching the phone records of another person charged, Zachary Rehl, who is the president of the Philadelphia chapter of the Proud Boys, a far-right group. Giddings is charged with two other men, Brian Healion and Freedom Vy, who were allegedly part of a Telegram message group with Rehl and another person who was not in Washington, D.C., on the day of the insurrection. The group coordinated travel from Philadelphia to D.C. ahead of Jan. 6, 2021, and Giddings, Healion and Vy stayed together at The Darcy hotel in D.C. on the night before the riot, according to court records. On the day of the riot, Giddings allegedly appeared in a photograph outside the U.S. Capitol with Rehl and others, all flashing the \"OK\" hand symbol, a gesture associated with the Proud Boys. The four men then allegedly entered the Capitol building, where the four of them appear in several photos and videos. In a reply to a text the next day asking how they were doing, Giddings allegedly wrote: “Yes we have everything and everyone all accounted for ... none of our Philly guys had any PB gear the entire event just plain trump supporters from beginning to end.\" According to news reports, the Proud Boys were directed not to wear their signature black and yellow on the day of the riot, aiming to blend in with other Trump supporters.

Portlock allegedly also joined a crowd of other protesters, chanting “heave-ho” and passing Capitol Police riot shields to other protesters in an attempt to push past officers blocking access to the tunnel into the Capitol. Portlock is a manager with Mitsubishi Motors, according to a LinkedIn page referenced in the FBI statement of facts. Court records show he was arrested on Nov. 3 in Smyrna, Tenn.\" (NPR)",

Wilson was a county-level leader of the Oath Keepers based in North Carolina, and he conspired with other members of the group to \"oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power,\" according to a statement of offense Wilson signed and submitted in federal court as part of his guilty plea. In the days and weeks after the November 2020 presidential election, Wilson exchanged messages with other members of the Oath Keepers about how they believed Joe Biden had stolen the election and, as Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes allegedly put it in one message, \"we aren't getting through this without a civil war.\" On Jan. 5, 2021, Wilson drove from North Carolina to a hotel in Vienna, Va., which is near Washington, D.C., and brought with him an \"AR-15-style rifle, a 9-millimeter pistol, approximately 200 rounds of ammunition, body armor, a camouflaged combat uniform, pepper spray, a large walking stick intended for use as a weapon, and a pocketknife,\" court documents state. Some members of the Oath Keepers allegedly remained at the hotel with a stash of weapons in order to act as a \"Quick Reaction Force\" that could bring arms into D.C. \"in case of worst case scenarios,\" as Rhodes reportedly wrote in one message. On the day of the riot, Wilson breached the Capitol and helped force open doors to the building's rotunda, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that at least 14 Oath Keepers breached the Capitol. Wilson left the building and later that evening gathered with Rhodes and other Oath Keepers at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. At one point, court documents state, Rhodes called an unidentified person via speakerphone and \"repeatedly implore[d] the individual to tell President Trump to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer of power.\" The person \"denied Rhodes's request to speak directly with President Trump,\" according to court documents, which do not state what relationship that person may have had to Trump. Afterward, members of the group reportedly had dinner at an Olive Garden restaurant and discussed the possibility of taking further actions to fight the transfer of power. In the days after Jan. 6, Wilson deleted messages and information about the alleged plot and threw his cellphone into the Atlantic Ocean.\" (NPR)",

A member of the Proud Boys, Ramey came into conflict with U.S. Capitol Police officers on the west side of the building; he was part of the mob pushing against the officers attempting to stop them from climbing the stairwell from the Lower West Terrace to the Upper West Terrace. It is here that Ramey sprayed officers in the eyes with an orange chemical agent, causing disorientation and pain. Though video footage of the incident was captured, the officers were not able to identify the perpetrator of the attack due to the impairment of their vision at the time. Ramey was identified using cell phone location data provided by AT&T--which showed that the phone belonging to Ramey had been using the cell site servicing the U.S. Capitol Building, testimony from the manager of Hilton Arlington Hotel, and identification from a former neighbor. Ramey was then arrested on charges of assaulting police, engaging in physical violence on Capitol grounds, entering a restricted building and civil disorder.",

On Nov. 25, 2020, court documents state, he posted on Facebook, \"I pray every night. I hope we dont have to hurt anyone. THESE JUDGES BETTER DO THE RIGHT THING.\" On Jan. 6, 2021, Milstreed allegedly threw a flagpole \"javelin-style\" at a group of Capitol Police officers guarding the outside of the U.S. Capitol. Later that day, Milstreed can allegedly be seen on video trying to move bike racks that police had set up as a barricade around the building and taking a smoke grenade that was on the ground on the side of the rioters and throwing it toward police. Milstreed then allegedly pulled and shoved a photographer working for The Associated Press, who was covering that day's events. That evening, prosecutors say, he messaged a Facebook friend, \"We f***** them federal cops up.\" Milstreed was arrested on May 24, 2022, in Brighton, Colo.\" (NPR)",

The substations were located in Norrisville, Reisterstown and Perry Hall, MD, and the final 2 in Baltimore City. They had previously mentioned targeting a substation in Delaware, just beyond the MD border, as well. According to prosecutors, the plans was to damage 5 electrical substations in the Baltimore area with gunfire or through the use of Mylar balloons to cause an electrical short. Then defendants talked about destroying a \"ring\" around the city, leading to 'complete destruction' of the city through 'cascading failures'--timing the attacks when the electrical grid was already strained (i.e., hot summer or cold winter). The couple were both unknowingly speaking to federal informants in prison during their conspiracy, leading to their arrest. Although the plans began in prison, they continued after Russell was released on parole August 2021, and a focus on the infrastructure attacks began June 2022. The couple met while both were incarcerated in separate facilities--Russell was incarcerated for possessing bomb making materials as part of the Atomwaffen Division, and Clendaniel was imprisoned for robbery. Clendaniel told the informant the she expected to die of kidney disease within months and wanted the attacks to leave a statement.

        "Short narrative":"\"The FBI alleges that images from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot show William Hendry Mellors firing a canister of bear spray toward police officers on a staircase leading into the U.S. Capitol, according to court documents. “Took a nice beat down from Washington DC police tonight. Some tear gas and a riot baton. Broken ribs and some stitches needed,” Mellors later wrote on Parler as a caption for a close-up photo of what appears to be his own bloody ear, according to an FBI statement of facts. Mellors told FBI agents in April 2022 that he’d joined some “rabid” protesters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, also mentioning that a group of Proud Boys had asked him to “walk some ladies back to their hotel to protect them from Antifa” during the Trump rally in November 2020. He added that the Proud Boys “seemed like nice people.” When FBI agents interviewed Mellors a second time in May, he said he expected to be arrested and confirmed he brought two canisters of bear spray to Washington. He was arrested on July 18, 2022, in Houston\" NPR",

        "Short narrative":"\"Nathan Weeden, 23, of Houghton, Michigan [was indicted] for conspiring with others and allegedly defacing Temple Jacob – a Jewish synagogue in Hancock, Michigan – with swastikas and symbols associated with The Base, a multi-state, white supremacist group...Weeden, along with other public documents filed in cases against alleged co-conspirators Richard Tobin of New Jersey and Yousef Barasneh of Wisconsin, support the following allegations. According to the indictment, in September 2019, Weeden, Tobin, and Barasneh – all members of The Base, a multi-state, white supremacist organization – allegedly used an encrypted messaging platform to discuss vandalizing property associated with African Americans and Jewish Americans. Weeden and his co-conspirators dubbed their plan, “Operation Kristallnacht,” which in German means “Night of Broken Glass” and is in reference to the events that took place on November 9th and 10th of 1938 in which Nazis murdered Jewish people and burned and destroyed their homes, synagogues, schools, and places of business. The indictment alleges that Weeden carried out this plan on September 21, 2019, when he spray-painted swastikas and symbols associated with The Base on the outside walls of Temple Jacob. Weeden is charged with two counts. The first count is for Conspiracy Against Rights under 18 U.S.C. § 241, a civil rights statute that makes it a crime to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in the exercise of their rights...The second count is for Damage to Religious Property under 18 U.S.C. § 247, also a civil rights statute that makes it a crime to intentionally deface, damage, or destroy religious property because of the race or ethnic characteristics of individuals associated with that religious property. The maximum penalty under this statute is 1 year imprisonment and a $100,000 fine...The grand jury issued its two-count indictment against Nathan Weeden on June 27, 2023. The indictment was unsealed on June 29, 2023, after the defendant was arrested by the FBI. He remains in custody at this time. The court will schedule Weeden’s arraignment, detention hearing, and trial at a later date.\" (DOJ)",
