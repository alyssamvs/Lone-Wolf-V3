The bomb-making materials were found amongst other neo-Nazi propaganda, including a framed picture of Timothy McVeigh and the Turner Diaries. Russell's attorney argues that Russell has mental deficiencies (ADHD and Autism) and that the bomb-makng materials were not going to be used.

As @doctorpepper35, Giampa tweeted about his hatred of transgender people and his admiration for Adolf Hitler. He tweeted about using Jews as target practice. Online, Giampa had repeatedly interacted with white supremacist groups, in particular the Atomwaffen Division. The Frickers had staged an intervention for their daughter to keep her from dating an \"outspoken neo-Nazi\" and had even reported Giampa's hate speech to the special education high school the two attended. Initially, Giampa was ruled incompetent to stand trial due to brain damage from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. After spending months in a mental hospital, Giampa was deemed competent to stand trial. Giampa's sentencing is coded as data not available because his records are not available through Fairfax County Circuit Court, and his name has not appeared in the news since 2019.",

Woodward was reportedly sexually confused and had a habit of \"pranking\" gay men on dating apps. Woodward met up with Bernstein and, when Bernstein tried to kiss him, stabbed him repeatedly in the neck. Because of the attack on Bernstein due to his sexuality, Woodward will receive a hate crime enhancement in sentencing.",

Jeffrey and his brother, Edward \"Teddy\" Clark, were active on the social media site Gab, where they were active in Alt-Right forums and in the white nationalist movement, attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, and were identiified as holding a Vanguard America flag in one of their images. They were both \"friends\" with Robert Bowers, the perpetrator of the Tree-of-Life Synagogue attack on October 27th, 2018. On the same day of the attack, Edward Clark took his own life, resulting in an escalation of Jeffrey's radicalized views. Two witnesses reported Jeffrey to the FBI due to his extreme agitation, worried he was a threat to himself and others. The witnesses assisted agents in recovering firearms and AR-15-modifying parts and conversion kits, and informed them of Jeffrey's drug use. In court, Jeffrey plead guilty to the drug charge but not the weapon charge, and was sentenced to time served (10 months) and 36 months of supervised release.",

Court documents say Hasson espoused extremist and white supremacist views and allege that he relied on the manifesto of Anders Breivik, a Norwegian who was convicted in 2011 of two terror attacks that killed 77 people. As detailed in court documents, to prepare himself to take action, in addition to the firearms and silencers referenced above, Hasson purchased holsters, knives, magazines, ammunition, handguards, camping supplies, Meals-Ready-to-Eat, steel body armor plates, plate carriers, tactical vests and pouches, firearm repair kits, and smoke grenades.",

Donovon Flippo was charged with third-degree assault (a class C felony) and fourth-degree assault. Flippo pleaded guilty to fourth-degree assault, a misdemeanor. On 7/17/2019 Donavan was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered him not to participate in any mass protests in Multnomah County. He must complete 40 hours of community service within six months and have no contact with the victim in the case. He also was sentenced to eight days in jail, which he already served after his March arrest in Clark County. After his arrest, Flippo was transferred to Multnomah County and posted bail. On 10/24/2019 he was sentenced to 10 days in jail for probation violation.",

He also threatened US presidential candiate Beto O'Rouke. In the chat logs accessed by the FBI Smith gave his fellow neo-nazis instructions on how to build IEDs ‘in the style of the Afghans',which an FBI bomb technician confirmed were viable. He also talked about his desire to \"kill...every last jew across the world\" and go to Ukraine to fight with the Azov Battalion. Smith was in communication with Craig Lang, an American that left to fight in Ukraine with the Right Sector. Smith is said to be affliated with Feuerkrieg Division (FKD) and recieved a 30 month sentence.",

    "narrative": "\"Benjamin Hung, 28, is accused of possessing a machete, a Glock and other weapons in his truck and driving into a crowd of racial justice protesters in Pasadena...[he] was using his family's vineyard as a \"training camp\" to prepare for \"civil disorders\"...was arrested after he accelerated a Dodge Ram adorned with several flags embraced by right-wing extremists and a license plate that read \"WAR R1G\" into a crowd in Pasadena, northeast of downtown Los Angeles. The 150 or so protesters were in the Old Town section of Pasadena on the afternoon of May 31. The agent says the protesters, who were chanting \"Black lives matter here,\" ran out of the way to avoid being hit. After being detained by local police, Hung told authorities that he felt threatened after protesters threw things at his truck, according to the complaint...No evidence corroborated Hung's account, the agent says, and officers who searched his truck found a loaded Glock handgun, a 15-round magazine, a machete, an 18-inch metal pipe, a megaphone and $3,200 in cash...Hung was charged with attempted assault with a deadly weapon in state Superior Court. Court records show that he posted $30,000 bond June 12. An arraignment and plea are scheduled for Tuesday...The complaint alleges that Hung was stockpiling weapons. A photo that authorities said they obtained from his iCloud account that was included in the documents shows assault rifles, semi-automatic pistols, magazines, ammunition, a tactical vest, binoculars, a rifle scope and other equipment. The agents say the guns were likely purchased out of state and kept at the home in San Marino...Hung was charged with illegally acquiring the Glock found in his truck and buying three out-of-state guns that he brought to California.

FBI agents arrested Rankin...and recovered a black semi-automatic rifle during the execution of a search warrant at his residence...According to the criminal complaint, Rankin was in unlawful possession of a firearm, with the capability and means to affect violence in furtherance of his beliefs and has expressed a desire to overthrow the government, specifically, the “three letter agencies” such as ATF, FBI and IRS...Rankin attempted to purchase two long guns from a San Antonio retail outlet on March 23, 2018, but was denied the firearms transactions under the “Prohibited Category” for previously being committed to a mental institution. After being warned by agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that he was a prohibited person, Rankin posted pictures of himself with a firearm on social media. On May 30, 2020, Rankin and others, carrying long guns and pistols, appeared at the Alamo in downtown San Antonio to attend a protest in reaction to the death of George Floyd. The next day, Rankin posted on his Facebook account photos of himself and others carrying a firearm at the protest as well as comments about his disdain for police including, “…hope they burn the precinct down” and “I’m BOOGALOO we hate police.”...on August 4, 2020, Rankin posted a “selfie” photo on his Facebook timeline showing him holding a black, semi-automatic rifle in a vertical position against his shoulder with his finger on the trigger. Rankin posted other photos which included a quote, stating, “Diligently Plotting to Take Over the World in order to Leave You Alone”. On August 11, 2020, Rankin arrived at the airport in Manchester, New Hampshire. He flew out of San Antonio International Airport the previous day. Rankin checked a semiautomatic handgun in his luggage while at the ticket counter, but missed a connecting flight in Philadelphia, PA. Upon his arrival in Manchester, Rankin was met inside the terminal by ATF agents who served Rankin written notice that he is prohibited from possessing firearms. The agents also provided him with copies of his mental health records. Agents seized the handgun and ammunition from inside Rankin’s luggage. Rankin threw the notice letter and mental health records in the trash receptacle before leaving the airport terminal. (DOJ press release)\"",

Hunter, an adherent of the Boogaloo movement, traveled from Texas to Minnesota in May 2020 and met up with other Boogaloo movement members who had mobilized to Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd. On May 28, 2020, during a period of rioting near the Third Precinct Building of the Minneapolis Police Department, Hunter fired 13 rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle into the entryway of the building. Following this criminal conduct, Hunter returned to Texas and continued to communicate with his fellow Boogaloo movement members, including Steven Carrillo – who shot two Protective Services officers at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Oakland, California on the same day as Hunter’s actions in Minneapolis.\" (George Washington University, Program on Extremism)",

According to the SS Indictment, defendants Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were affiliated with the “Three Percenter” movement (sometimes rendered III%), while defendants Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan-based “militia” group with similar anti-government views. Ty Garbin entered a guilty plea in January 2020 to the original indictment charging him with conspiracy to kidnap Governor Whitmer and was sentenced to 75 months in prison. In April 2021, a Superseeding Indictment was issued to the five remaining defendants. Harris and Caserta pleaded not guilty and were both acquitted of all charges. Franks pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 48 months in prison. Fox and Croft Jr. pleaded not guilty and were convicted by jury trial in August 2022 of conspiracy to kidnap the governor and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against persons or property. Croft was additionally convicted of knowingly possessing an unregistered destructive device, specifically an improvised explosive wrapped in pennies for shrapnel. Fox was sentenced to 192 months in prison, and Croft was sentenced to 235 months in prison.",

The FBI stated a tipster reported Secor founded the campus organization \"America First Bruins\" and is a member of Bruins Republicans. The FBI stated Secor can be seen in a group of rioters pushing their way into the building.

At one point, he chanted “break it down!” with a crowd—referring to a door located in the Speaker’s Lobby that was barricaded by police. Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, one of the four pro-Trump protesters who died on Jan. 6, was fatally shot by a police officer while attempting to break into the Speaker’s Lobby...Bennett shared conspiracy theories online prior to the insurrection. On Jan. 4, Bennett posted a conspiracy-laden message, including his belief that President Joe Biden stole the election and Hunter Biden’s laptop....On Jan. 11, Bennett admitted to federal agents that he went to D.C. and “that he knew it was wrong” to storm the Capitol.

Rush and his codefendants were charged with Conspiracy to Destroy Records in Official Proceedings for conspiring to destroy communication records relating to the murder. The Facebook group’s description stated, “they say the west won’t boog,” a reference to the “boogaloo” movement. The indictment alleged that a member of the Grizzly Scouts exchanged messages on the WhatsApp group with other Grizzly Scouts, in which that member allegedly told the group that he was preparing to engage in a shoot-out with law enforcement. Rush immediately instructed the Grizzly Scout member on the WhatsApp group to delete evidence on his phone. Rush, Blancas, Ybarra and Miksch then deleted records of their Whatsapp group, including the prior discussions regarding violence against law enforcement and Carrillo’s message to the group—“Dudes i offed a fed” indicating that he had killed a federal law enforcement officer. The indictment also alleges that less than an hour after the shooting in Ben Lomond, Blancas deleted files related to the Grizzly Scouts from a Dropbox account. Further, within hours of the shooting, members of the Grizzly Scouts, including Rush, Blancas, Ybarra, and Miksch allegedly began to reconnect on an alternative communications application. Moreover, the indictment alleges that the four defendants each deleted records of the WhatsApp group communications from their phones, including the prior discussions regarding violence against law enforcement. Rush pleaded guilty to Conspiracy to Destroy Records in Official Proceedings and was sentenced to 6 months in prison.",

    "narrative": "Kenny Matthew Miksch, the \"1st Lieutenant\" of the \"1st Detachment, 1st California Grizzly Scouts\" militia group responsible for training and firearms instruction, was alleged to have purposefully impeded the federal investigation and trial of Steven Carrillo, a Grizzly Scouts member who murdered a federal Protective Service Officer (PSO) in Oakland, California. The Grizzly Scouts are a militia group associated with the \"boogaloo\" movement. The indictment alleged that a member of the Grizzly Scouts exchanged messages on the WhatsApp group with other Grizzly Scouts, in which that member allegedly told the group that he was preparing to engage in a shoot-out with law enforcement. When a member admitted to killing a federal officer, Miksch's co-defendant Blancas deleted 20 files from their Dropbox account, including that discussing the group's rank structure, a non-disclosure agreement requiring members of the Grizzly Scouts to maintain the confidentiality of the group’s materials, a liability release waiver, descriptions of Grizzly Scouts uniforms, and a scorecard to assess members of the Grizzly Scouts with respect to combat, firearms, medical, and other training. Rush, Blancas, Ybarra and Miksch then deleted records of their Whatsapp group, including the prior discussions regarding violence against law enforcement and Carrillo’s message to the group—“Dudes i offed a fed” indicating that he had killed a federal law enforcement officer. The members then reconnected on alternative messaging servers where members repeatedly confirmed that they had destroyed evidence relating to the Grizzly Scouts, of which Carrillo was a member. Miksch was charged with Conspiracy to Destroy Records in Offical Proceedings. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 6 months in prison. ",

In a second interview with agents, the FBI seized Watson's cellphone, and he admitted that he had entered the building. On that seized phone, law enforcement found photos from inside and outside the building and texts sent shortly after the riot, one of which read \"I was one of the people that helped storm the capitol building and smash out the windows .

While the Capitol riot was ongoing, Grods allegedly rode in a golf cart with others members of the Oath Keepers to the Capitol, then breached the building while carrying what prosecutors describe as a \"large stick.\" Soon after, Grods exited the building as law enforcement used pepper balls to try to force people out of the Capitol, the court documents state. Later, he allegedly met with other members of the Oath Keepers outside the Capitol building, and, in the days after the riot, said he had deleted his messages on Signal. As part of a plea agreement, Grods has agreed to testify in court and sit for interviews with investigators.\" (NPR)",

He was dubbed #TartanPlaidPB by online sleuths who are researching those who participated in the Capitol riot, then turning that information over to the FBI. Jackson is seen in photos numerous times on Jan. 6 with Proud Boys from Arizona, and wore one of their orange arm bands, the FBI stated. However, in an interview with the FBI at his home, agents said Jackson told them he is not affiliated with the Proud Boys and doesn't support their ideology. He said they gave him the orange band and he stayed with them for protection because he had traveled to Washington, D.C. alone. However, the FBI noted that in December, one of his social media connections tagged him in a post about a group of Proud Boys being in New York City. In a social media post included in the court records, Jackson said he didn't agree with the \"MAGA tribalism,\" and didn't commit any violence. Jackson stated in the post that he had evidence of BLM, Antifa, police officers and \"Non Trump\" extremists \"causing the mayhem.\" Jackson also stated that he's a college student studying to be a political science professor. \"My only love is the United States of America,\" he wrote. At the Capitol, records show he carried a U.S. flag and was with a crowd singing The Star-Spangled Banner after the detonation of an explosive device in the crowd. He then pointed toward the Senate Wing of the Capitol and moved that direction. The agents noted he was seen on video in Statuary Hall and other locations inside the Capitol.\" (USA Today)",

According to court records, Bergstrom is a “self proclaimed Boogaloo Boi” who was initially arrested at a Greyhound Bus Station in Phoenix, Arizona in January 2021. Bergstrom’s initial arrest was based on probable cause that he committed felony misconduct involving weapons, in violation of Arizona criminal code. After being released, Bergstrom failed to appear for his preliminary hearing, and a bench warrant was subsequently issued for his arrest. On March 13, 2021, Bergstrom was identified by the FBI as a participant in an event in Louisville, Kentucky, which was attended by multiple adherents of the Boogaloo movement. During the event, Bergstrom was arrested by law enforcement, who discovered a handgun on his person. A search warrant for Bergstrom’s cell phone also revealed screen shots of a pair of Greyhound bus tickets from New Mexico to Ohio, purchased under aliases, in an attempt to conceal Bergstrom’s identity and flee Arizona to avoid prosecution.\"",

    "narrative": "\"David Dempsey came to the attention of federal investigators through public tips from the Sedition Hunters -- people researching the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. On the day of the Capitol riot, federal prosecutors allege, Dempsey wore an American flag-themed neck gaiter as well as a combat-style helmet, camouflage pants and a tactical vest. In one video described in court documents, Dempsey stood in front of a gallows erected outside the Capitol and said that Democrats in Congress \"need to hang from these motherf****** [pointing to gallows],\" and that \"Hopefully one day soon we really have someone hanging from one of these motherf******.\" During the riot, Dempsey allegedly used a lacrimal agent -- such as pepper spray -- as well as a crutch and a metal pole to attack police officers guarding the Capitol building. Dempsey was arrested in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2019 over allegedly using bear spray to attack anti-Trump protesters there. Dempsey pleaded no contest to a charge stemming from that incident. The Justice Department notes in its court filings that Dempsey can be seen in multiple photos from Jan. 6 wearing a black- and yellow-colored bracelet. Black and yellow are the colors associated with the far-right extremist group known as the Proud Boys. In one photo described in court documents, Dempsey made the OK sign while standing next to people wearing Proud Boys attire. The \"OK\" sign, which the Proud Boys frequently use, is often associated with supporters of white supremacy, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Dempsey was arrested on Aug. 26.\" (NPR)",

    "narrative": "Joshua Dillion Haynes, 39 of Virginia, pled guilty to Obstruction of an Official Proceeding and Destruction of Property in the Territorial Jurisdiction. He was sentenced to 32 months in prison for his role in the Capitol Raid. He was recorded on video attacking members of the media at a staging area near the Capitol, crushing their equipment and stealing their camera. According to local news reporting, Haynes was angry specifically at CNN. \"Court documents also show images taken from another video that allegedly show Haynes, along with two others, attempting to pull an air conditioning unit from outside the Capitol building. Haynes was identified by a tipster who used publicly available facial recognition software to match images from photos with a post from a Parler profile, and agents subsequently pulled the subscriber records to find a phone number and email address. Search warrant records for the phone reportedly show that Haynes used it the day of the riot to take pictures inside the Capitol and at the media staging area, and to text with friends. One selfie depicted Haynes inside the office of a U.S. senator, court documents indicate. Later, texts were allegedly exchanged between Haynes and other individuals that indicated he had broken windows and crawled into the Capitol. Prosecutors say one friend texted Haynes the message “dont [sic] be like antifa tearing stuff up.” Haynes replied, “ahhhh tooooo late,” “broke lotsa stuff,” and then “lol.” Haynes reportedly indicated he was seen destroying media equipment, saying \"i Kicked the fake news a**\" and \"I am in the video destroying stuff but I'm wearing a mask.\" FBI agents went to Haynes' house and interviewed him at length. Haynes allegedly said he believed riot suspects were being treated badly in contrast to people who had participated in Black Lives Matter protests and that he respected those who used force against law enforcement to \"stop the election from being stolen.\" Haynes attended a Proud Boys meeting in late 2020, court documents indicate, but denied he was a member of the far-right extremist group, saying he \"would have joined the chapter, but it was too far away and there were no members of the Proud Boys in his local area.\"\" (NPR)",

He took photos of himself at the event and posted them to social media; the posts were then found by the FBI, who connected the posts to a phone number belonging to Spain and to usage of a cell site servicing the interior of the U.S. Capitol Building on the day in question. Spain was later interviewed at his Oklahoma home, where he confirmed his presence at the riot and his entrance into the United States Capitol. Spain was then charged with Entering and Remaining in a Restricted Building or Grounds; Disorderly and Disruptive Conduct in a Restricted Building or Grounds; Disorderly Conduct in a Capitol Building; Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building following his participation in the Capitol riot.

    "narrative": "Footage of the livestream filmed within the U.S. Capitol on January 6 by Anthime Gionet showed Daniel Goodwyn, 32, who was called out as \"sfthoughtcriminal,\" within the building during the violent events that took place that day. Goodwyn stated his full, correct name into the camera and was shown confronting officers that told him to leave by calling them \"oathbreakers.\" An associate of Goodwyn conversed with him over Instagram regarding his participation in the riot and recorded a post to Goodwyn's account stating that he entered the Capitol without causing any damage; screenshots of both, turned over to the FBI, were what alerted them to Goodwyn in the first place. Goodwyn is a member of the politically-violent extremist group known as the Proud Boys, which was known to be prevalent and active in the siege of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. In the months leading up to it, Goodwyn made several declarations over social media that signaled his affiliation with them as well as his support for the objections to the results of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election that catalyzed the gathering of protesters at the U.S. Capitol that day. After this information was collected, Goodwyn was arrested and charged.",

According to documents filed in federal court, Loehrke communicated in December 2020 with Ethan Nordean, a leader of the extremist group the Proud Boys who is facing conspiracy charges connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Nordean allegedly told Loehrke that he wanted Loehrke \"on the front line\" with him on Jan. 6, 2021. Loehrke allegedly agreed and said he was bringing three \"Bad mother f******\" with him to Washington, D.C. On the day of the attack, prosecutors say, Loehrke and Haffner marched with members and associates of the Proud Boys toward the Capitol. They then allegedly dismantled barriers protecting the outside of the Capitol building. When a line of police protecting the outside of the Capitol stopped people from advancing farther, Loehrke allegedly said, \"Don't back down, patriots! The whole f****** world is watching. Stand the f*** up today!\" At one point, Haffner allegedly used an aerosol spray against an officer with the U.S. Capitol Police guarding an outer door. Soon after, prosecutors say, Haffner, Loehrke and other rioters were able to breach the building through that door and can be seen in video footage taken inside the building. Ronald Loehrke was arrested in Cumming, Ga., on Dec. 3, 2021. (NPR)",

    "narrative": "Law enforcement allegedly identified Isaiah Giddings as a person who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot after searching the phone records of another person charged, Zachary Rehl, who is the president of the Philadelphia chapter of the Proud Boys, a far-right group. Giddings is charged with two other men, Brian Healion and Freedom Vy, who were allegedly part of a Telegram message group with Rehl and another person who was not in Washington, D.C., on the day of the insurrection. The group coordinated travel from Philadelphia to D.C. ahead of Jan. 6, 2021, and Giddings, Healion and Vy stayed together at The Darcy hotel in D.C. on the night before the riot, according to court records. On the day of the riot, Giddings allegedly appeared in a photograph outside the U.S. Capitol with Rehl and others, all flashing the \"OK\" hand symbol, a gesture associated with the Proud Boys. The four men then allegedly entered the Capitol building, where the four of them appear in several photos and videos. In a reply to a text the next day asking how they were doing, Giddings allegedly wrote: “Yes we have everything and everyone all accounted for ... none of our Philly guys had any PB gear the entire event just plain trump supporters from beginning to end.\" According to news reports, the Proud Boys were directed not to wear their signature black and yellow on the day of the riot, aiming to blend in with other Trump supporters.

Once there, he moved to the vicinity of the terrace on the west side of the Capitol, where he joined others in pushing against law enforcement at the arched entrance to a passageway into the building. The group of rioters collectively pushed against officers, at times rocking together in a coordinated way, to gain entry to the interior of the building. He remained in this area for a period of more than 45 minutes. Later, according to the court documents, Fischer moved to the west front of the Capitol. Once there, he threw chairs, an orange traffic cone, and a pole towards officers.",

Portlock allegedly also joined a crowd of other protesters, chanting “heave-ho” and passing Capitol Police riot shields to other protesters in an attempt to push past officers blocking access to the tunnel into the Capitol.

Wilson was a county-level leader of the Oath Keepers based in North Carolina, and he conspired with other members of the group to \"oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power,\" according to a statement of offense Wilson signed and submitted in federal court as part of his guilty plea. In the days and weeks after the November 2020 presidential election, Wilson exchanged messages with other members of the Oath Keepers about how they believed Joe Biden had stolen the election and, as Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes allegedly put it in one message, \"we aren't getting through this without a civil war.\" On Jan. 5, 2021, Wilson drove from North Carolina to a hotel in Vienna, Va., which is near Washington, D.C., and brought with him an \"AR-15-style rifle, a 9-millimeter pistol, approximately 200 rounds of ammunition, body armor, a camouflaged combat uniform, pepper spray, a large walking stick intended for use as a weapon, and a pocketknife,\" court documents state. Some members of the Oath Keepers allegedly remained at the hotel with a stash of weapons in order to act as a \"Quick Reaction Force\" that could bring arms into D.C. \"in case of worst case scenarios,\" as Rhodes reportedly wrote in one message. On the day of the riot, Wilson breached the Capitol and helped force open doors to the building's rotunda, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that at least 14 Oath Keepers breached the Capitol. Wilson left the building and later that evening gathered with Rhodes and other Oath Keepers at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. At one point, court documents state, Rhodes called an unidentified person via speakerphone and \"repeatedly implore[d] the individual to tell President Trump to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer of power.\" The person \"denied Rhodes's request to speak directly with President Trump,\" according to court documents, which do not state what relationship that person may have had to Trump. Afterward, members of the group reportedly had dinner at an Olive Garden restaurant and discussed the possibility of taking further actions to fight the transfer of power. In the days after Jan. 6, Wilson deleted messages and information about the alleged plot and threw his cellphone into the Atlantic Ocean.\" (NPR)",

It is here that Ramey sprayed officers in the eyes with an orange chemical agent, causing disorientation and pain. Though video footage of the incident was captured, the officers were not able to identify the perpetrator of the attack due to the impairment of their vision at the time. Ramey was identified using cell phone location data provided by AT&T--which showed that the phone belonging to Ramey had been using the cell site servicing the U.S. Capitol Building, testimony from the manager of Hilton Arlington Hotel, and identification from a former neighbor. Ramey was then arrested on charges of assaulting police, engaging in physical violence on Capitol grounds, entering a restricted building and civil disorder.",

That evening, prosecutors say, he messaged a Facebook friend, \"We f***** them federal cops up.\" Milstreed was arrested on May 24, 2022, in Brighton, Colo.\" (NPR)",

All three men had ties to neo-nazi, white supremacist, and fascist groups on Telegram that frequently shared violent and terroristic content. During the planning, Kenna sent a message to Tierney and Brown stating \"Looks like we're getting this paper jew money while it lasts. Just in time to invest into bigger and better things\" indicating that a white supremacist, antisemitic, pro-Nazi ideology may have played a role in the intent to conspire to commit the bank robbery. Sentencing is scheduled for 11/03/2023. ",

    "narrative": "Brandon Clint Russell (aka Homunculus & Raccoon), 27, and Sarah Beth Clendaniel (aka Nythra88 & Kali1889), 34, are accused of conspiring to destroy energy facilities in the area of Baltimore, Maryland and Delaware. The substations were located in Norrisville, Reisterstown and Perry Hall, MD, and the final 2 in Baltimore City. They had previously mentioned targeting a substation in Delaware, just beyond the MD border, as well. According to prosecutors, the plans was to damage 5 electrical substations in the Baltimore area with gunfire or through the use of Mylar balloons to cause an electrical short. Then defendants talked about destroying a \"ring\" around the city, leading to 'complete destruction' of the city through 'cascading failures'--timing the attacks when the electrical grid was already strained (i.e., hot summer or cold winter). The couple were both unknowingly speaking to federal informants in prison during their conspiracy, leading to their arrest. Although the plans began in prison, they continued after Russell was released on parole August 2021, and a focus on the infrastructure attacks began June 2022. The couple met while both were incarcerated in separate facilities--Russell was incarcerated for possessing bomb making materials as part of the Atomwaffen Division, and Clendaniel was imprisoned for robbery. Clendaniel told the informant the she expected to die of kidney disease within months and wanted the attacks to leave a statement. Investigators located a document, described as resembling a manifesto, which includes references to Ted Kaczynski, Anders Brevic and Adolf Hitler. The two reportedly were in contact from 2018 until their arrests in February 2023. Russell is a former Florida National Guard member and a founder of Atomwaffen, and Russell lived with Devon Arthurs, another Atomwaffen member arrested in 2017 for murder, but who had similarly planted to attack US electrical sites and nuclear power plants.",

Some tear gas and a riot baton. Broken ribs and some stitches needed,” Mellors later wrote on Parler as a caption for a close-up photo of what appears to be his own bloody ear, according to an FBI statement of facts. Mellors told FBI agents in April 2022 that he’d joined some “rabid” protesters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, also mentioning that a group of Proud Boys had asked him to “walk some ladies back to their hotel to protect them from Antifa” during the Trump rally in November 2020. He added that the Proud Boys “seemed like nice people.” When FBI agents interviewed Mellors a second time in May, he said he expected to be arrested and confirmed he brought two canisters of bear spray to Washington. He was arrested on July 18, 2022, in Houston\" NPR",

On January 6, 2021, Ackerman was part of the crowd that attempted to break a police barricade in the Lower West Terrace of the U.S. Capitol Building. During the riot, Ackerman acquired a U.S. Capitol police helmet, something he termed a \"war trophy.\" Ackerman later attached a New England 131 sticker to the helmet, a sticker referencing the small neo-Nazi group named the Nationalist Social Club 13.",

According to the indictment, in September 2019, Weeden, Tobin, and Barasneh – all members of The Base, a multi-state, white supremacist organization – allegedly used an encrypted messaging platform to discuss vandalizing property associated with African Americans and Jewish Americans. Weeden and his co-conspirators dubbed their plan, “Operation Kristallnacht,” which in German means “Night of Broken Glass” and is in reference to the events that took place on November 9th and 10th of 1938 in which Nazis murdered Jewish people and burned and destroyed their homes, synagogues, schools, and places of business. The indictment alleges that Weeden carried out this plan on September 21, 2019, when he spray-painted swastikas and symbols associated with The Base on the outside walls of Temple Jacob. Weeden is charged with two counts. The first count is for Conspiracy Against Rights under 18 U.S.C. § 241, a civil rights statute that makes it a crime to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in the exercise of their rights...The second count is for Damage to Religious Property under 18 U.S.C. § 247, also a civil rights statute that makes it a crime to intentionally deface, damage, or destroy religious property because of the race or ethnic characteristics of individuals associated with that religious property. The maximum penalty under this statute is 1 year imprisonment and a $100,000 fine...The grand jury issued its two-count indictment against Nathan Weeden on June 27, 2023. The indictment was unsealed on June 29, 2023, after the defendant was arrested by the FBI. He remains in custody at this time. The court will schedule Weeden’s arraignment, detention hearing, and trial at a later date.\" (DOJ)",
