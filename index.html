        <p>Let’s go back to 1978. At the same time as Ted Kaczynski was starting his mail bombing campaign, a novel named ‘The Turner Diaries’ was published by a white supremacist, depicting a violent takeover of the US government.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="caption" data-index="2">
        <p>This novel would later become widely influential and go on to fuel a number of right-wing acts of terror, including the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="caption" data-index="3">
        <p>It wasn’t until the 2010s, however, when the current standard of copycat terrorism started to emerge, starting with the mass shooting at Oslo and Utoya committed by Anders Breivik. Like Ted Kaczynski, he published a manifesto, and like the Oklahoma bombers, he was also inspired by the Turner Diaries. Five different perpetrators of right-wing violence list him as their source of inspiration — chief among them Brenton Tarrant, the 2019 New Zealand mosque shooter, who live-streamed his attack. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="caption" data-index="4">
        <p>By the early 2010s, social media channels such as 4chan, 8chan, and Twitter (and later, Telegram), had become hubs for amplifying attacks, encouraging would-be perpetrators, and portraying those that engage in violent acts as ‘saints’. It’s through these channels that the idea of these perpetrators as lone-actors falls short of accurate: in their manifestos, there are traces of each other’s writing. They follow each other on social media. They belong to the same ‘Terrorgram Collective’ group chats, they talk to each other. Encourage each other. And copy each other. </p>

      <div class="caption" data-index="6">
        <p>Before his mass shooting, he published a 180 page manifesto, a third of it plagiarising other manifestos, particularly that of Brenton Tarrant. He rambled about the Great Replacement conspiracy, also espoused in the Turner Diaries. And he praised the works of three other prior mass shooters. Like them, he wore body armour, a Go-Pro camera, and an AR-15. He wouldn’t be the last one. </p>

    <h2>Beyond the Myth</h2>
    <p>There is a clear trend towards an increased number of attacks, by a younger, but well prepared lone-actor (with some improvements in the last two years). However, the attackers themselves are getting radicalised at a faster rate. Continuing to treat these as one-off events instead of an organised, massive global network, and failing to appropriately monitor platforms such as Telegram, will not be effective in preventing these attacks. </p>
