        <p>Over the last few decades, mass-casualty events such as the Buffalo shooting have taken place at increasing rates across the globe. Like Gendron, their perpetrators are often young, and male — and in almost every case, they act alone.</p>

        <p>After 2021, we observe some decline in 2022 (33 events) and 2023 (18 events), but numbers remain significantly higher than pre-2018 levels.</p>

        <p>First, a little bit of context:</p>

      <div class="caption">
        <p>In the United States of America, only 6% of convicted terrorists are lone actors. However, that 6% is responsible for a quarter of all terrorism convictions between the 1980s and 2015. To this day, they represent the majority of terrorist attacks in the US.</p>

      <div class="caption">
        <p>In Europe, too, right-wing lone-actor terrorist killed more than Islamic or ISIS-inspired terror plots from 2000 to 2014. </p>

      <div class="caption">
      And across the Western Hemisphere, lone-actors carried out 93% of fatal terrorist attacks over the last five years.

  <!-- OUTRO SECTION -->

  <div class="outro">
    <h2>Beyond the Myth</h2>
    <p>Rather than dismiss these perpetrators as mentally ill outliers, authorities should place increased emphasis on the monitoring of online communications from known extremist sites and forums, as this has shown effective in preventing attacks, such as with the Finland Kankaanpää terror plot.</p>
