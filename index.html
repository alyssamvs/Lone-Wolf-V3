            <p>‘Lone-actor’ right-wing extremists tend be viewed as ‘one-off’ events, and media outlets are usually more reluctant to label them as terrorists (as opposed to organised or Islamic terrorism). Their narratives often centre on their anti-social behaviour, troubled past, or mental health issues.</p>

            <p>But looking closely at these seemingly isolated perpetrators, patterns among them start to emerge.</p>

  <!-- OUTRO SECTION -->

  <div class="outro">
    <h2>Beyond the Myth</h2>
    <p>Rather than dismiss these perpetrators as mentally ill outliers, authorities should place increased emphasis on the monitoring of online communications from known extremist sites and forums, as this has shown effective in preventing attacks, such as with the Finland Kankaanpää terror plot.</p>
