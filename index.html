        <p>'Lone-actor' right-wing extremists tend be viewed as 'one-off' events, and media outlets are usually more reluctant to label them as terrorists (as opposed to organised or Islamic terrorism). Their narratives often centre on their anti-social behaviour, troubled past, or mental health issues.</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Myth</h2>
