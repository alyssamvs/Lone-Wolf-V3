        <p>Let’s go back to the beginning. 1978. At the same time as Ted Kaczynski was starting his mail bombing campaign, a novel named ‘The Turner Diaries’ was published by a white supremacist, depicting a violent takeover of the US government.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="caption" data-index="2">
        <p>This novel would later become widely influential and go on to fuel a number of right-wing acts of terror, including the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="caption" data-index="3">
        <p>It wasn’t until later, however, when the current standard of copycat terrorism started to emerge, starting with the mass shooting at Oslo and Utoya committed by Anders Breivik. Like Ted Kaczynski, he published a manifesto, and like the Oklahoma bombers, he was also inspired by the Turner Diaries. <br><br>
        Five different perpetrators of right-wing violence list him as their source of inspiration — chief among them Brenton Tarrant, the 2019 New Zealand mosque shooter, who live-streamed his attack. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="caption" data-index="4">
        <p>By the early 2010s, social media channels such as 4chan, 8chan, and Twitter (and later, Telegram), had become hubs for amplifying attacks, encouraging would-be perpetrators, and portraying those that engage in violent acts as ‘saints’. Brenton Tarrant's presence here, after his attack, was widespread. 
          
          <br><br>
          
          It’s here that the 'lone-actor' definition falls apart: in their manifestos: the would-be attackers are, in many cases, nothing short of a community. They quote each other, follow each other on social media, share memes of group chats -- they <em>talk</em>to each other. Encourage each other.<br><br> And they copy each other. </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="caption" data-index="5">
        <p>Which brings us back to Payton Gendron. </p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="caption" data-index="6">
        <p>Before his mass shooting, Gendron published a 180 page manifesto, a third of it plagiarising other manifestos, particularly that of Brenton Tarrant. He rambled about the Great Replacement conspiracy, also espoused in the Turner Diaries. and he praised the works of three other prior mass shooters -- like them, he wore body armour, a Go-Pro camera, and an AR-15. Gendron copied them. And less than a year later, others would copy him.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="caption" data-index="7">
        <p>A typical lone actor perpetrator is white, male, and young, though there are outliers. And although in the early 2000s it was common for perpetrators to be associated with right-wing organisations, most recent lone-actors have no links to such organisations. In fact, a worrying trend for the past three years is for perpetrators, particularly young ones, to have no defined ideology or political slant, but rather a focus on aesthetics, performance, and hero-worshipping of past shooters -- for example, Highland Park shooter Robert Crimo, school shooter Natalie Rupnow, and market shooter Arda Küçükyetim.</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Myth</h2>
    <p>There is a clear trend towards an increased number of attacks, by a younger, but well prepared lone-actor (with some improvements in the last two years). However, the attackers themselves are getting radicalised at a faster rate. Continuing to treat these as one-off events instead of an organised, massive global network, and failing to appropriately monitor platforms such as Telegram, will not be effective in preventing these attacks. This project hopes to provide insight into the connections between these perpetrators, in order to change our perspective of what ‘lone-actor terrorism’ really means. </p>
